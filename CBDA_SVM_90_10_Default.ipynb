The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.","Amazing!",1],["I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music.

And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^","an absolute masterpiece",1],["This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs!

As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players.

Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky).

Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed.

Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.","Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes",1],["This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her.

As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'.

The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.</td><td>Amazing!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music.

It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^</td><td>an absolute masterpiece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs!

If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.</td><td>Delicious cookie mix</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE.

I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family.

Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints.

The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey).

The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988.

However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie.

This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings.

You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the \"power-up segments\" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun.

But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book.

The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it.</td><td>Maybe I got a bad one.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil.

The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back.

I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.</td><td>Nice for the money</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is \"clean and proper\" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are \"tourist guides\" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time.

It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.</td><td>Profound then. Truly horrible now.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time.</td><td>Definitely enjoyed!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie.

She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop.

Great fun for all!!</td><td>Rapunzel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money.</td><td>[Not what I expected]</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to \"explore somewhere else in the castle.\"Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is \"currently disabled.\" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks.

She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her.</td><td>Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by \"decorating\" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages.</td><td>Use your imagination!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one \"castle\" for the kids to \"decorate\" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the \"castle\" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.</td><td>Not so good - ok for a rental!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work.</td><td>NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company.

While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par.

Hopefully, \"Nite Versions\" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release \"Nite Version\" on 12\" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move.

This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music.

With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.</td><td>a great book for Historical romance lovers</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series.</td><td>YES!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.</td><td>Not the best in the series</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am disappointed in its performance.

However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.</td><td>Very authentic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba.

She sings the \"Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!\" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, \"train\" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.</td><td>Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game.

Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one?

After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME.

Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. \"Goes Good With Beer\" and \"Little Devil\" would be great singles to spice up country radio. \"Letters From Home\" deserves to be single of the year and \"Cool\" is not far behind.

Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, \"well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.\"Should be more explicit in the instructions.

The games is to car racing what space invaders is to \"Battlefield\".

My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an \"incurable\" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a \"real\" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14\" and 3\". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old.

I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns.

You can't make this stuff up.</td><td>Good for a laugh</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.</td><td>As Bad a Production as Possible</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.</td><td>Not professional quality</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.</td><td>three to four stars - depending...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by \"the Starlite Singers\".</td><td>Good songs, bad cover.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the \"Starlite Singers\". The description of the record says that it is by \"various artists\" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.</td><td>New Wave 80s</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!</td><td>Don't Be Fooled!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!</td><td>Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes.

There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.</td><td>Never gets going</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!</td><td>Now, The Rest of the Story</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all.

My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy \"Trouble on Titan.\"</td><td>This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already.

Some have features where you can \"spin\" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a \"look at me\" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)</td><td>They're blocks - keep that in mind</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters.

She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots.

They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places.</td><td>Wonderful but not worth $80.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the \"fun\" factor. For younger babies that may not \"get it\" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months.

Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool.

And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen.</td><td>It was \"ok\" but I won't watch it again</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!</td><td>Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming</td><td>mask maker</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert.</td><td>mask maker</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!</td><td>NOT the worst American B-Movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.</td><td>MASK OF FAMILIARITY</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.</td><td>Unmasked..................</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.</td><td>A museum exhibit inside a book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed.

Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen.

This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.</td><td>Stiff and Smells like drying paint</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative.</td><td>Review of Pillow</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new.</td><td>Don't bother</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh.</td><td>Worthless and cheap</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed.</td><td>Will not be purchasing another one of these</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.</td><td>False Advertisement</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied.

It appears that the \"Controlgel\" is out of production. This \"Smoothing Serum\" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the \"Controlgel\" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the \"Controlgel\" product would come back.

Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!</td><td>LOVE IT!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough.</td><td>The Best !!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made.</td><td>Great control racquet</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money.</td><td>DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this.</td><td>Bad skating technique</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile.</td><td>A complete waste</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it.</td><td>4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game.</td><td>Barbie's Boring Ice Show</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud.</td><td>WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>All the other reviews say this product is boring and \"save your money\"....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater \"never falls\"?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!</td><td>IT'S GREAT!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the \"frustration factor\", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a \"5\" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the \"easy\" and \"medium\" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd.</td><td>A good game to buy.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went.</td><td>Great Game</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called \"Perfect Gentleman\" with 2 titles on it: \"Ooh la la\" and \"One more Chance\". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.</td><td>Not really what I wanted</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read.</td><td>Rare find</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated.

All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon.</td><td>Dark Horses a must have CD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply.

I think I'm in love with Ash!</td><td>The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is \"This is a paranormal disaster area!\"</td><td>Beautiful Love Story</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!</td><td>The Best Yet!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!</td><td>The Best</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!</td><td>Soul-mates</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!</td><td>Possibly the Best out of this series!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!</td><td>Amazing!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies.</td><td>One of the best books I've ever read!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK</td><td>Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it.</td><td>One of her best in the Night World series!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?</td><td>2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called \"Daughters of Darkness\" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???</td><td>I'm hooked and I want some more ...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has</td><td>L.J. Smith has so many correct details....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.</td><td>It was great!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.</td><td>Disappointing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.</td><td>mirroring the reader</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it.</td><td>Don't Waste Yout Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time.</td><td>Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA.</td><td>Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities.</td><td>A rare & wondeful treat</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too.</td><td>nifty</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again</td><td>Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus \"feature\" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed.</td><td>Very annoying!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the \"Sing A Long\". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.</td><td>Extremely Disappointed with this video</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a DVD with footage of a \"Come Out and Meet Thomas\" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the \"party/interview\" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.</td><td>Just so-so</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.</td><td>More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.</td><td>A long promo for the Thomas center(s)</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.</td><td>Poor DVD</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.</td><td>My Son finds it annoying</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*</td><td>Feels like a commercial...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!</td><td>Makes you not want to sleep at night.....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this \"$25,000\" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?</td><td>$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling.</td><td>Great little surge protector</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the \"stretch\" waist band they are tight. So much for an \"extra\" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.</td><td>Too Small</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.</td><td>A good product available in convenient range of sizes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND.

The waist band does NOT stretch.</td><td>Cut smaller than usual</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything.</td><td>Wrong item sent.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad.</td><td>Too bad....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product.</td><td>Dockers do the job.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants.</td><td>False advertising</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. \"Cafe,\" for example, should be \"Coffee.\" Despite the fact that the image for \"Cafe\" shows a stone or very light gray color, \"Cafe\" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.</td><td>Don't Trust the Images</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are \"deals\" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.</td><td>So disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children.</td><td>Fantastic Book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher.</td><td>Disturbing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying.</td><td>A Taste of Italy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>.... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above.</td><td>Perfect book for a long flight....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a \"trifle overdone\" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons.</td><td>Delicious reading</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.</td><td>Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!</td><td>I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it.</td><td>One of the best!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard \"chick lit\" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to \"Roman young stud\" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than \"Cooking for Mr. Latte\" - it was a fun read.</td><td>Cameriere!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!</td><td>Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film.</td><td>\"Chick Lit \" for \"Foodies\"</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?</td><td>Not very good....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is \"the best ever experienced\" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.</td><td>Do not waste your time....lousy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.</td><td>The food is sexier than the sex</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere.</td><td>Back to basics</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY.</td><td>CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words \"huh,\" \"what,\" and \"yeah\" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what \"so-called\" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it.</td><td>Just as trashy as garbage music comes...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time.</td><td>this album is garbage,straight bfi material</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I feel ya \"Ghenry187@aol.com\"...this CD rocks.

What a rip.</td><td>save your $$$</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk.</td><td>PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy.</td><td>Worst music ever....but I love it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album</td><td>classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this album hea is just \"too hot\". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys \"Guerilla Warfare\". like i said in the beginning \"not 5 starz 6 starz\", if you know what i mean!</td><td>NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE.

Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one...</td><td>Please try another Hot Boy album...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 \"I Need A Hot Girl\", \"We On Fire\", \"Respect My Mind\" & \"Tuesday & Thursday\". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? \"Ridin'\" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like \"Clear Tha Set\" by Lil'Wayne. \"Ya Dig\" by Juvenile. \"Help\" by B.G., and \"Bout Whatever\" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. \"Too Hot\" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!</td><td>Fun To Listen To.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez.

And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called \"Madame Castel's Lodger,\" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller</td><td>A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).</td><td>An old friend</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online.</td><td>NOT A RIDE ON</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML.</td><td>Excellent - Very Useful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!</td><td>Wonderful. A thorough reference guide.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced.</td><td>Fantastic Advanced Course!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help. The topics have been beautifully explained. HTML, XML, CSS,DHTML are no longer nightmares for me. I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs. This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML. I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference. The book is worth buying. This is worth 5+ star rating.</td><td>Simply excellent !!! No Comparision</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details.</td><td>Complete reference... yes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts.</td><td>Good place to start Web development</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it.

Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart.</td><td>Thoughtful, contemporary fiction</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.</td><td>Why Some People Complain</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat.

We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!</td><td>Great Glider</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product.

It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio.</td><td>Fantastic glider/ bench</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>James Moody, and his well known \"cast of characters\" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it.

What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day.</td><td>Seal IV</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States.</td><td>Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.</td><td>Too Much on the Mystical Plate</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs.</td><td>God's Zoo</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics.

For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.</td><td>An interesting little essay</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the \"in-laws\" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live \"Happily Ever After\". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.</td><td>Great Actors - Well done film!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of \"boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married\" this movies looks at the question of \"then what?\" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better.</td><td>Great movie, not so great DVD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway).</td><td>an extreme emotional ride</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.</td><td>Grrrrr.

As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player.

A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not.

Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author.

Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the \"pounce on each other in the first chapter\" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts.</td><td>A change from the Carpathian Series</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special \"gifts\" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has \"gifts\" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the \"I hate you!\" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting.</td><td>Riveting</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards.</td><td>Not her best...........</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a \"mystery\" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read.</td><td>This one is missing that Feehan Spark</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library.</td><td>Intriguing story</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!</td><td>amazing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more \"Dark Series\" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-(</td><td>Too Boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, \"leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to\". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.</td><td>Ick ack. Put it back.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again.</td><td>disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.</td><td>Not up to scratch!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done.</td><td>WONDERFUL GOTHIC</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN...

Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.</td><td>An Old World change that's definitely wonderful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!</td><td>Great Reading</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now.</td><td>I really wish i hadn't wasted my time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace.

Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money.</td><td>Poor support</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Just as promised, worked well for what I needed.

The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes.

Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now.

He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with.

The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the \"who\" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, \"great book, bad ending...\" and still give it 3 stars or more.

This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.</td><td>Love Scarpetta</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no \"grab\" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, \"I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.\"Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel</td><td>A really bad book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies.

A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened?

I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more.</td><td>Cruel and Unusual</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.</td><td>Muddled ending disapoints</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read.</td><td>Spellbound!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.</td><td>Very nice book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books.</td><td>Too scattered, too shallow</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.</td><td>Soooooooooooo NOT Funny</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say \"What on earth is this?...\" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing.</td><td>Totally Unfunny</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.</td><td>Nasty People! Nasty Film!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!</td><td>zero star</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing.</td><td>Dramedy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 movie/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. I should have walked out like so many others did.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!</td><td>The Not so Funny People</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>His movies seem to be going down hill. The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it. Other then that, it is just not that funny. Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free.</td><td>What happend Sandler?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets.</td><td>serious comedy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about \"comedy\" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me.</td><td>Long, somewhat dull and unfocused</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying \"tweet\" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.</td><td>WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press.</td><td>Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama.</td><td>Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved \"Knocked Up\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for \"Bruno\" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it.</td><td>Not so Funny people!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really \"funny people\" involved movies, like \"ANGER MANAGEMENT\" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious \"LITTLE NICKY\".</td><td>Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/</td><td>Not what I expected...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it.

I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life. I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie. I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once.

She said, \"we saw this movie already\" and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument, she claims WE saw it and i said, Vat ? i am getting alzheimers?Finally we figured it out. we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out.adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies. but this one really eats the bird!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!</td><td>worst film ever</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.</td><td>The L O N G E S T movie... EVER!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you.</td><td>profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.</td><td>Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this.

I wish someone had warned me.</td><td>Please just run far FAR away from this film.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny?

I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in.</td><td>Not entirely a comedy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw.

A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans.</td><td>Sfar's Best!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma</td><td>The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.</td><td>A wonderful, funny-sad book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.</td><td>good artwork too!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"The Rabbi's Cat,\" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.</td><td>Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.</td><td>Self-Serving Message</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.</td><td>Not what it looks like on the cover.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up.</td><td>The Last dissenting Witness</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - \"Jean Hill -The Lady in Red\" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website.

She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the \"little dog\" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!</td><td>Drivel</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another \"MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY\" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans.

In a word, I sum these writings as \"nonsense.\" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book.

It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner</td><td>Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book.</td><td>The Best Patricia Cornwell's book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a character I have enjoyed develop.

Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story</td><td>If you can't say anything nice,</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth</td><td>Great read</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.</td><td>You have GOT to be kidding</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This supposed \"thriller\" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through.</td><td>My brain froze over</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic \"grit\" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!</td><td>Losing her edge?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are \"as pale blue as a malamute's\", when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star.</td><td>The devil in the detail</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you love meaningless running around, plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief, andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies, you might put up with this one. Otherwise . . . the book disappoints. One gets the impression that it was written in haste. A pale imitation of the previous work . . .deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables (if not in a Potter's Field for books).</td><td>The pits . . . a contrived pot-boiler. Avoid it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books</td><td>So far, the worst book of one of my favorite authors</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel.</td><td>Very Dissapointing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am on my 8th Scarpetta story. I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's.</td><td>Intelligently written; a fast and suspenseful read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed.</td><td>What a disappointment!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.</td><td>Just awful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the \"intrigue\" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out.</td><td>A wildly implausible thriller</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell.</td><td>From Potter's field, buried with no name</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story.</td><td>Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G.</td><td>No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This books just didn't do it for me. I enjoy PC but this book. Seemed too easy. Things just happend, people just called. In fact, I think this books had some bad editing. I felt as though all what was needed was there, and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reason.I am still a fan, but this one is a skipper.The doc just happens, to see the resturante that the killer was using.The polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police. Just does not at add.</td><td>a let down</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it.</td><td>To contrived and therefore not plausible</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled! Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it. I read 1/3 of the book and threw it in the \"yard sale\" pile. It's the first book of hers I've read and I don't intend to pick up a second one. This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for non-readers and quick profits.</td><td>Stilted and Hokey</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page. A woman's body is found in the snow in Central Park. There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult. Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending. It is one of her best. By Ruth Thompson author of \"The Bluegrass Dream\"</td><td>Terror in Central Park</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery. I've never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel.</td><td>Patricia Cornwell rocks!

Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal.

Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy.

First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else.</td><td>Worthless</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well.</td><td>There's no other book like this one!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!</td><td>Don't bother!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read.

He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace.</td><td>Explains why economics and politics don't mix!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the \"common good.\" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand.</td><td>a brilliant, well-written economics primer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor \"mandatory reading\" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!!

Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book.</td><td>More of a personal opinion than that of economics</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was actually looking for a book on economics... This book is more of a conservative rant. It's not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics. Buy this book if you want to hear how much the author thinks liberalism stinks... not if you want \"Economics in one lesson.\" I definitely feel like I got tricked into buying it.</td><td>Not what it claims to Be</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well.

Policies based entirely on fallacies!!</td><td>The best book on Economics...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V.</td><td>3.5 Stars-A useful supplementary text for lower division microeconomic principles courses only</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero.</td><td>Title is a Scam</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.</td><td>NO Help</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have \"the answer,\" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general.</td><td>Polemic and Outdated</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat.</td><td>Too simplistic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics.</td><td>This ain't no economics book!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology.</td><td>No lessons learned</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book.</td><td>Best book on Economics for the general reader</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy.</td><td>If you don't have this, get it!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO.</td><td>Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it.</td><td>Give this book to a your children.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Economics in One Lesson is another great \"must read\" book. Like Bastiat's \"The Law,\" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful.</td><td>ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and \"higher education\" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute.</td><td>Never more needed than today</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope</td><td>Economics even you will Understand</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's \"Crashproof\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression.</td><td>Simply brilliant!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As a student and teacher of economics, this book has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy (or any other arm of policy making, for that matter). Whether you agree with Hazlitt's conclusions about how the market works or not, you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book. It is entertaining to read, particularly easy for a book about economics. I highly recommend it!</td><td>One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read.</td><td>Textbook</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it.</td><td>Our Senators and Reps should read and heed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Very easy to read, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book.</td><td>Great Book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library.</td><td>Painful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.</td><td>Unsatisfactory and very outdated</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book.</td><td>Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.</td><td>Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.</td><td>Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to \"explode liberal myths\" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the \"successes\" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy.</td><td>Right-libertarian views presented as fact</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book. It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date.</td><td>ASTOUNDING</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad.</td><td>how to fail economics 101</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as \"common sense.\"</td><td>Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.</td><td>Back to basics...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.</td><td>A great alternative perspective</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off.</td><td>Sanity in Economics</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great primer that should be read in all schools. Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime.</td><td>Fine Summary</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas.</td><td>A good libertarian primer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt.</td><td>Important</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times.</td><td>Economics</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's.</td><td>Frighteningly Prophetic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost).</td><td>Great book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an \"Adam Smith\" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title.</td><td>Great summary of some very difficult economic principles</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.</td><td>over-simplified diatribe</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.</td><td>More politics, less economincs</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.</td><td>This book's title is misleading.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.</td><td>Seriously Flawed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Hazlitt has an opinion, and he presents it here. I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues, but more importantly, spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals.This book fails in that respect. Keep looking. (Samuelson, Mankiw, Malkiel...)</td><td>Not a primer, way too political</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!</td><td>Straight to the trash can!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Let me first say I'm into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). I have latelly been checking out the Euro scene of music(I don't know bought a Bmw could have been influencing me lol). I like this chick(not only cute) but she is cute and beats are catchy. Their music makes wanna make me drive fast. The older I get(30), the more I listen to beat and the complete way the music is put together. So liking the Goldfrapp stuff. So I by these cd's for my girl(while secretly ripping them to my zune). Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here.

This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station.</td><td>Egbert is such a wonderful name</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.</td><td>sweet musings for loss and love</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine.

More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city.

I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album.</td><td>not quite what I was expecting</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to \"feel\" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up.</td><td>Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I.</td><td>Nineteen folktales of South and Central America</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book was an anthology of 19 stories.

I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review.</td><td>It wasn't very good!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book.</td><td>Very boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.</td><td>on order</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1\". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised.</td><td>Long torso but great product</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer.</td><td>Love This Item</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer.</td><td>Had some problems at first but now i love it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try.</td><td>Good choice for getting a vintage look</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires.</td><td>Squeem works well</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again</td><td>Too small - NO RETURNS</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier!! Don't give up it is worth it!</td><td>wow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!</td><td>Great!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point.</td><td>Wasn't what I expected</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove.</td><td>great</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you.</td><td>a good smoother</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I \"tried out\" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me \"back fat\" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two \"size options\" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your \"natural\" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my \"under/side boob\" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)</td><td>Works Well!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone.</td><td>squeem cincher</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.</td><td>not really worth it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller.</td><td>Great product; great seller!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible.</td><td>Painful Experience</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down. I've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money.</td><td>Great Product!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.</td><td>poor fit</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!</td><td>Not recommended!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The product did what it was \"supposed to\" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd.</td><td>Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as \"New\" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as \"New\"</td><td>Advertized as \"New\" but arrives worn out</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have one of those \"spare tire\" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to \"make\" me look trimmer...</td><td>Great results, with some side effects...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)</td><td>Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...</td><td>Upset</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to \"right-sized\" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost.</td><td>Falling apart</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it.</td><td>ahi</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.</td><td>Incrediby difficult to put on</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,</td><td>Squeem</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive.</td><td>A bit uncomfortable...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. I love that you can't see it under clothes. I notice my back feel better with it on, my posture improves, and I look good in my clothes. I love this!</td><td>This is the one</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it.</td><td>really love it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!</td><td>Wow!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my \"excess\" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me.</td><td>Not the shape I was going for....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones.</td><td>Bones</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!</td><td>Magic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress. Unfortunately, they shipped the WRONG thing, and now I am stuck with a big, bulky and hideous vest! It has very ugly racerback straps, and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress. And the worst part, I'm out the money! I can't even return it for a refund, even though I haven't opened the box. VERY disappointed in this company. Buyer beware!</td><td>Wrong item shipped!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips.</td><td>Sizing is Ridiculous</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?</td><td>So what is the sizing?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This corset makes me Sweat like a hog, I am not I'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape, was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it, because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable, hot and sweaty underneath. This was bad for my skin too, it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods. It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I'd want to take it off immediately, so I never wore it, and just gave up and returned it. Still looking for a perfect corset, this however is NOT it. Don't waste your time.</td><td>Causes sweat that makes it unwearable!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed \"WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist\"...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td><td>best money I ever spent on shape wear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times.</td><td>works great</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening.</td><td>Great at first...not so good over time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape. I had a slimmer waist within weeks. You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on. It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to, but I would wear it only while working out. Otherwise, I would take it off.19 years later, after having my second child, I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it. I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts. It is well made and sturdy. The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising. I recommend this product.</td><td>Recommend this</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. It also folds in with the fold of my stomach, which I didn't want, so it doesn't get that pooch area as well as I would've liked. I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good, thats about it.</td><td>boning is not a plus</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed.</td><td>Pass</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought.</td><td>Love this!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!</td><td>Poor quality</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the \"Extra firm compression\". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!</td><td>Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews.</td><td>Not the best shaper</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!</td><td>It works, BUT....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores</td><td>squeem</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product.</td><td>Product defective after 1 day of use</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!</td><td>a great buy!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)</td><td>No,No,No This is not for me.....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product.</td><td>Can't Go Wrong With This Item!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:(</td><td>Would be great but...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it</td><td>works but uncomfortable</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money.</td><td>Major let down!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it</td><td>Awsome!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :(</td><td>Wasnt worth</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!</td><td>GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service.</td><td>Not so much</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing.</td><td>Burn Rubber on Me</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better.</td><td>Not worth the price...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP</td><td>Torture</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply.</td><td>Squeem</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach \"pooch\". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!</td><td>I'm very impressed so far</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a \"flat\" stomach just flabby and then I have \"love handles\" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would.</td><td>Not for everyone</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. The first couple of wearings were difficult, but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me, I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter, as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping, but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep, rather than in the daytime, but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made.</td><td>Squeem:> A Combination of Scream and Squeeze?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it.</td><td>excelent product!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!</td><td>Hard to put on</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!</td><td>Why does everybody rave when....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..</td><td>Uncomfortable!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems...</td><td>Great idea, poor design</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit</td><td>best shapewear</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.</td><td>Waste of time for me</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed.</td><td>Not OK!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. However, I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound. Not worth the pain.</td><td>Not worth the pain it causes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. my grandmother even notice it, and she didn't even know i bought it. It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body. I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium.</td><td>I love It!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real \"waist trainer\", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for \"waist trainer\", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a \"cincher\" or a \"trainer\".</td><td>disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that.</td><td>itchy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>i realy love my shape wear, i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she's notice a big difference,</td><td>i love it..</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9\" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes...</td><td>Wow, Ow and What's that smell?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>i have a 28-29 inch waist normally. should've started with a size Small. the XS seemed a bit smaller than described. definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist!</td><td>squeem is pretty good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!</td><td>Snug Fit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.</td><td>Poor quality and lousy customer service</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem \"Magical\" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star. More worthy of steaming diarrhea.</td><td>IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.</td><td>Very sturdy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. it really flattens the tummy area, which is all I really want, but you can see the hooks threw clothes :( I felt like that ruined it for me, also I had to keep pulling it up. It bunches in the back, and really smells like rubber. After about 5 or 6 days one of the \"bones\" on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side! it really hurt. I would not recommend this product.</td><td>Worked for 5 days then broke</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color. could be little cheaper</td><td>does its job</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size.</td><td>Squeem</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. This really holds you in, its comfortable and I don't think it shows through your clothes! I highly recommend!!</td><td>So Far So Good!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone.</td><td>Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx.</td><td>simple quick fix</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses. It also offers great support for your back. It is perfect for everyday wear.</td><td>A must have...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them</td><td>The squeem waist cincher</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets.</td><td>Wasn't that impressed........</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked the Squeem. I'm a petite person, but have some love handles that I need to hide when I'm wearing tight clothes. The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it's tight.</td><td>Squeeeeeze into your clothes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27\" waist before pregnancy, 30\" waist when I bought a size medium, 28\" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted...</td><td>Love it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read the reviews for this product and purchased. I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake. I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably. For me if I don't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don't feel it's working. The thing I like the most about it is that's it's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top. Body hugging tops excluded, of course. I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town.</td><td>Good product</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn't work as described on the advert. I've never been so sore (both side) in my entire life. I cannot wear it for more than 2h. Other then the product itself, the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 5-8 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later. What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didn't use correct stamp or pay the full charge. :@</td><td>Waste of money</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now.

I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately.</td><td>Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site.

I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again.</td><td>Dont order them in white or any light color</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous.

Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it.

However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review.</td><td>WARNING: This is the worst book ever written</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.It¡s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.It¡s obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins....</td><td>Edge of Danger</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything.</td><td>Edge of Danger</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book.</td><td>Actually, this book is not worth one star.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward.</td><td>Not Worth The Reader's Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax.</td><td>Disappointing and too simplistic</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is simply the worst book I remember reading. I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels, so I happily picked this up. I'm sorry I did. It is nothing but action, which might be OK for a fun read on the beach, but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous. Massive action scenes (such as large battles) take place in only 1 or 2 pages. There's no character development, poor dialogue, no setting descriptions, no drama or suspense -- nothing but a poorly-described series of \"events\"! Enough said.</td><td>Worst Book I've Ever Read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, \"Edge of Danger\", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector.</td><td>Formula Writing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.</td><td>Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it.</td><td>Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler.</td><td>Writing on autopilot</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. \"Damn, he said to Kate, \"It's the Hazar Scouts, \" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good</td><td>Sophomoric at Best</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.</td><td>A Waste of Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.</td><td>Plenty of action</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books.</td><td>Good story- Poor writing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?</td><td>Do I have to give it 1-star?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead.</td><td>Disappointment on every page</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker.</td><td>I would rather watch paint dry</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't.</td><td>Tired formula</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book.</td><td>This is not the Jack Higgins I know</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss.</td><td>Completely predictable</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??</td><td>EXTREMELY SHALLOW</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?</td><td>Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did.</td><td>Can't believe I read the whole thing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Very few books contain their own review. This one does:\"Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'\"'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'\"This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle.</td><td>I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts.</td><td>A bad book, poorly written.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment</td><td>higgins disappoints</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.</td><td>Poorly Written</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. The writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. Save your money for something better.</td><td>A Disappointment</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The \"adventures\" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the \"reliablity\" of the author.</td><td>Horrible</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment.</td><td>Not worth the effort</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to \"speak Irish\" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing.</td><td>Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out. Also there didn't seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded, and on the surface stupid, behaviour.</td><td>Disappointing and thin</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA</td><td>Two Hacks</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book.</td><td>Just skip it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this CD for one song only, \"Steal Away\". I knew it was going to be \"live\", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a \"muzik, lounge\" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was \"Hot Rod Hearts\", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings?

The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well.</td><td>A Moral Novel with a Mystery</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.</td><td>Excellent Book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product.</td><td>technical problems with cassettes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous \"A\" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's \"masterpiece.\" Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's \"A\" interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book.</td><td>Mundane, Tedious, Just Plain Boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS.</td><td>Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED.</td><td>Absolute Waste of Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment.</td><td>A Tedious Read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I will never understand how \"Classics\" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is.</td><td>Classic? Really?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline.</td><td>This book was OK............</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature.</td><td>I've read better.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</td><td>Awakening.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book.</td><td>The Scarlett Letter</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy.</td><td>Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy.</td><td>Gripping</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!</td><td>Good read, but hard to navigate ebook</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint.</td><td>Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Book is a great read. Intriguing from start to finish. Cant find anything wrong to say. Would reccomend for beginer to advanced readers.</td><td>love it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store - way to go Amazon!</td><td>remembered from High School (eons ago)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I loved this book in high school, and I love it now. A tale of a strong woman that doesn't let society bring her down.</td><td>A Classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do.</td><td>Typos</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden.</td><td>Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I tred to enjoy this novel.

Above all of that the price was great.</td><td>The scarlet Letter</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way.</td><td>Review From One Book At A Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected.</td><td>Amazingly Good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture..</td><td>interesting book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture.</td><td>Not my idea of a good read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand.</td><td>Good book to read if you were bored to death!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there.</td><td>A well written book!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!</td><td>The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across.</td><td>Bad Book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad.</td><td>Duller than dirt</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend.</td><td>I must say</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character.</td><td>too hard to follow</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this \"Classic\" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down.</td><td>Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoy this book very much. It is a timely classic with which I am happy to now have my own copy.</td><td>Wonderful classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes.</td><td>Worth the effort</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Easy A\" explains it best. If you can't relate in some way you must be a robot. Greatest book ever.</td><td>Puritanical ostracism</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain.</td><td>Wasted Time</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans.</td><td>Tragic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it.</td><td>Great</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>it's nice. Very nice. Good indeed. I like it. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Exciting. Yes. Do you agree? Hester. Dimmesdale. Pearl. Chillingworth.</td><td>It's nice</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loved this book as well. The movies as always stray from the book- I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters.</td><td>Classic tale</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My son had to read this for school and ended up really liking the story. It opened up dialog with us (his parents) about social situations, opinions and morality.I asked him about this review and he chose the review title and star rating.</td><td>A Classic Worth Reading</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Please, I beg of you, if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter.</td><td>DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. It's a classic, must-own for anybody that values the concept of reading. And if you didn't like it the first time, read it again and give it a second chance. I've read it about six times and it gets better each time. Cherish this book.</td><td>My favorite classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times.</td><td>Scarlet Letter review</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition.</td><td>Excellent romance in an excellent edition</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers.</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz.....</td><td>Terrible book, do not read it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary. I have understood two chapters! I don't see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences! It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering. As I stated before, this is not my kind of book!</td><td>Meaningless Drivel</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It is my invariably correct opinion that the so-called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed, with EXTREME prejudice, for crimes against humanity and the English language.</td><td>Worst. Book. Ever.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being \"one of the best novels ever.\" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, \"Ok, so what's the point?\" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time.</td><td>Who Chooses Classics?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a \"CLASSIC\"?</td><td>\"Hallelujah!\" is what I said when I finished this book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Everyone needs to read this classic. An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers. I really appreciated it a lot.</td><td>a must read</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of \"The House of the Seven Gables.\" Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed \"The Scarlet Letter,\" complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)</td><td>Teachers: This is not his best novel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie \"The Scarlet Letter\" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different.</td><td>Very good and very unlike the movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It's hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. It is not kindle ready, although it is textually complete. Should be a freebie.</td><td>not kindle ready</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>this book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so, all's well I guess, and the condition of the book was quite acceptable.</td><td>good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book.</td><td>Boring, very</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My english teacher assigned this book, one I would never read on my own. I am a 16 year old and I enjoy reading. But this book, while it does have a few good points and messages, is incredibly dull. The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class. While this book has a rather good story it`s concealed by endless symbols and references, I suggest the cliff notes version!!</td><td>Boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow. Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn't understand them until they were pointed out to me. If you don't get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don't read it. There is a lot of symbolism in this book, too.</td><td>Really Hard to Follow</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards.</td><td>A fascinating look into another time's mores</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call \"Old English\" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to \"New English.\" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read.</td><td>One word: outdated</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times.</td><td>I was fored to read it too</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a \"classic\" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!</td><td>a tragedy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here</td><td>too had to read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars.</td><td>Simply the worse book ever.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book.</td><td>No Active Table of Contents</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>To me this book would turn a young person, like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading . Being a book with extensive mistakes in it, it is very difficult to read unless you are to inerpret it every paragraph or should I say sentence. I't maybe a classic, but I feel that the word \"classic\" comes from just being old........................................................................................................p.s the only reason I put a star was because I had to, to express my opinion on he novel.</td><td>Should not be a requirement in high school</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is like a bad soap. No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star.</td><td>It was like a bad dream, but I couldn't wake up</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me.</td><td>Landscape book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO.</td><td>THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. She has enjoyed reading it through out X-mas vacation. I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift.</td><td>Excellent gift</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>For a first time reading of this classic I recommend this. If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf. This is a nice quality book though. The printing isn't too small, and neither is the book. It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like it.And as for the story, I could go on many pages. Just do a few searches for reviews, it's a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture, past and future.One of the best Classics, great one to get started on or to read over and over again.</td><td>Great classic for the price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We \"looked inside this book\" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class.</td><td>Missing Custom House</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I absolutely loved this book, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions, it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive. A flawless book.</td><td>Incredibly engrossing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story.</td><td>Characterization in The Scarlet Letter</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic.</td><td>the illiteracy of our generation</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Great book, had seen the movie but the book is much more. It will hold your attention and is an easy read too.Even better, the e-book was free on Amazon!</td><td>The Scarlet Letter e-Book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am an avid reader. I have read many so called \"classics\". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say \"I have not read the Scarlet Letter.\" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried.</td><td>I just don't get it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>loved it in high school, love it as an adult...Great book and very informative.Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer.Characters and other plot.</td><td>favorite classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times.</td><td>Childish Novel</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring. Unless you're interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism, avoid this book.</td><td>Jeff the Scorned</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word \"ugh\" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through \"dost thou\" after \"dost thou\" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book \"The Classics Reclassified\".</td><td>Ugh.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it, but I just did not like it. Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good, it doesn't help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend.</td><td>This book was dumb</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace.</td><td>Avg. Rating too high</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.</td><td>Received a different book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, \"Baby daddies,\" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster.</td><td>Oh my...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con. He did not know much about it, but heard some people talking about it in the food court. I thought it sounded awesome, like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader. So I order what I thought was the graphic novel, turns out it is more \"novel\" and less \"graphic\". It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think \"BANG!\" \"POW!\" or \"ZORT!\" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name. His physiognomy is dead on as well, like in all comics, it let's us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all. Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars.</td><td>Far too little crime and fist fights</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it.</td><td>Get to the point already</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres.</td><td>Slow moving predictable story</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this \"perfect\" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her \"lover's\" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good.</td><td>Good book if you look into it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood.</td><td>Great!!!!!READ ME READ ME READ ME!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other \"classic\" stories that could be included in the curriculum.</td><td>Horrific forced reading</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!</td><td>I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me.</td><td>I don't get it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.</td><td>I hate this book.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I got the auido book cuz I didn't have time to read the book for my english report and exam. I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam. I did better listen than reading.</td><td>its as if I were reading the book itself.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class. I consider this cruel and unusual punishment. I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel! Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne.</td><td>Way too boring for me</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I believe that the plot of \"The Scarlet Letter\" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style. Sometimes it just dragged on forever & I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue---I couldn't enjoy a book like that. I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!</td><td>Great plot, horrible writing!!!!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!</td><td>get it away</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is.</td><td>Overrated Pretentious Trash</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time.</td><td>The Scarlet Letter</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthorne's masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed. It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as \"sinners\" are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Best (or worst) of all, the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life. Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter 'A' on his chest for the rest of his term.</td><td>A classic novel with a contemporary message</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What greater journey than to delve into the human heart? Every emotion one can nurture there is here, bared and examined.Hester, at once forthright and complex, serves as our guide, as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart.That we can fall, sin, disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day.</td><td>Each read is like peeling layers of a rose</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Well-paced, surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used. I hadn't read it in 30 years, and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager. There must be a lesson in there somewhere...\"</td><td>A better read as an adult -- not a great choice for teenagers...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on.</td><td>Don't pay for this on the Kindle</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period.</td><td>Strong Woman</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen.</td><td>Slow, Overwritten Drama</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library.</td><td>Great Story ... Bad writing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise.</td><td>Wonderful, wonderful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word \"Classic\" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was \"meaty\" (whatever that is), \"deep\", and \"powerful\"; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle.</td><td>Awful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring.</td><td>So boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider.</td><td>The okay book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying.</td><td>I HATE THIS BOOK</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!</td><td>Don't READ THIS BOOK!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Well, im 15 years old and my english teacher assigned this book for the class. I read only 6 of the chapters and then gave up . Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it - but it has nothing to do with modern life.And to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless. Like I really care about what happenes to Hester. I've failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same. Its one of those books where you read 4 pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today. Then i have to read the pages all over again. The book is extremely boring !! - I do not recommend it!</td><td>If your looking to fall asleep than this is perfect 4 you !</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.</td><td>slowly falling asleep</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for \"fun\", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it.</td><td>one of the worst books I've ever read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!</td><td>I only gave it a star because I had to.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's \"work\". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation.</td><td>paralyzing fear</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is \"ignominiously\" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now...</td><td>A sin to humanity</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>where to bloody begin.... ah.. in my junior year i and everyone else in class was forced to read the book and watch the horrible origanal slow and boring movie. after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck, right at the same time. both this and the great gatsby sucked. but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it</td><td>forced to read the most horrible book ever</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another \"Classic\").</td><td>This book is a wast of good paper</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>this novel is of course set in england in the eighteeth centuryher a young woman jailed for crimes she commted outside themarriage was branded with a scarlett letter over her bossom.this was tipical of the ear and time.</td><td>scarlet letter</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!</td><td>Looooooooooooooooong.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately, I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order. I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school. (Report is due Oct 25) and to date, October 9, I have NOT RECEIVED it yet. When I contacted the vendor to report last week, I basically received a \"sorry for your luck, but once it leaves our hands, we really don't care\" type of response. Totally not impressed.</td><td>Unable to Review</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online.</td><td>Painful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone.</td><td>Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I agree 100% that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer. But this book was horrible. A simple phrase of action (Hester walking down the street) would be 4 pages of reflection. I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck, J.D Salinger, Mark Twian. I hated this book. It was took long and nearly impossible to read. If you have to read it for school, good luck. Otherwise, avoid this. There are much better classics than this.</td><td>Save Yourself</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring.</td><td>Ick.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!</td><td>confusing, but good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed. not only was this a time of \"witchcraft\" and witchunts, but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery. as if it weren't punishment enough for hester to have to wear the \"a\" on her chest, everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society. i think this is overly harsh, yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well. i would recommend it.</td><td>SAD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!</td><td>The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time, this book required my full attention.</td><td>great!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words.</td><td>Beautifully Done</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses.</td><td>Not What it is Made Out to be...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont.</td><td>hate this new format</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Once you get past the language barrier, this book is an amazing read. To see the tragedies that some women went through at one point in history is a great thing, and to remind us never to let history repeat itself.</td><td>Wonderful</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!</td><td>Need a dictionary!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible.</td><td>An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. \"The Scarlet Letter\" is a \"classical\" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a \"Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy\". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read \"Huck Finn\" by Twain.</td><td>Leave this one to the bibliophiles</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic! (I still can't) After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars. Also, it is one of the better books that I had to read for school. I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more. I still wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone</td><td>Yes, I was another victim who had to read this for school</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America ; and at a bargian price</td><td>a book value</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ..... . . . . .. . . .</td><td>Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better).</td><td>Not interesting at all</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book.</td><td>This book is incredibly boring!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered \"a classic,\" such as Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories.</td><td>Both forward and backward in its ideas</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!</td><td>I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in.</td><td>Not Worth Reading</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity.</td><td>Power to women</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century, however, this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter. The descriptions get very long, boring and tedious. As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you can't remember what happened for chapters at a time. The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book.</td><td>it was very slow.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my 11th grade English GT class's summer homework. I read and read, and I just started hearing names of people who, didn't make sense. I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is, or that other guy they talk about, I just went a long skimming the book, not able to feel any plot whatesoever! I was completely bored with this book. I didn't need a dictionary whatsoever either, but I will probably need Cliff Notes, so I could understand what the story is about, if anyone can help, please do.</td><td>It wasn't good</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools? Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that's fantastic. But for most kids, give them something they'll enjoy reading and maybe they'll learn to love literature more. Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers.</td><td>ugh</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>At some point in your life you may have to read this snooze fest, and I pity the day you are required to read it. Hawthorne takes days to make a point, any statement at all, starting from the unbearable introduction \"The custom house\" through the last page. There is no action, no humor, no joy, only the character study of the puritan society, and a \"brave\" woman. Do yourself a favor and get the cliffnotes or use Antistudy.com. Anyone who truly believes this is a good is either a pseudo-intellectual, or they enjoy the same style of Melville, or anything written by Hawthorne. I would give this no stars if possible.</td><td>A classic...but one of the worst books, ever.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one.</td><td>How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably.</td><td>unfinishable</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference).</td><td>American classic my ...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love, adultery, and sadness. Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \"The Custom House,\" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway.</td><td>Hawthorne's Masterpiece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature.</td><td>Useful for AP Lit</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \"A\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \"Angel\" instead of \"Adulterer.\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us.</td><td>Timeless Classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written.</td><td>One of the Greatest Books Ever Written</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other \"Plumeria\" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion.</td><td>Does not have true plumeria scent</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof!

These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book.

Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap.

I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel.

It's a daring movie that take a rare look at what we've been missing in today's corperate -hectic (kiss butt) culture. And that is emotional honesty. It's like a release, a drug, or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are, and not necessarily how we act in everyday life.

This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it.</td><td>Nauseating!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it, but there are always exceptions.If you're looking for a sweet Christmas tale, watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. If you're looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a \"moral\" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it. There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there, but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness.</td><td>Spare yourself.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I thought this was a big dissapointment!

One reviewer states, \"the funniest Christmas movie ever\". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it.</td><td>8 Crazy Nights</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end.</td><td>Clean it up!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I can't believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes. How in the world did anyone watch this for 30 minutes? So I only watched 10 minutes, but a movie that starts the way this one does is not getting any more of my time.

Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none.</td><td>Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>8 crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious.

The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it).

Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!</td><td>Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this.

I must admit that it is very crude at parts, so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters, it probably isn't suitable for the young ones. Although, I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads.The message is good and the overall story has a message. I cried for Whitey, and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch. But it is HILARIOUS, from the triple breasted lady, to Whitey and his sister, to the deer (who's significance I really didn't understand).A must see for anyone <over 13> with a good (but stupid) sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs!</td><td>Hilarious</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This movie is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better.

I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from \"Billy Madison\" to \"Punch-Drunk Love\". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for \"Eight Crazy Nights\". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last.</td><td>Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this \"feature\" to anyone. \"Eight Crazy Nights\" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch \"Ishtar,\" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest.</td><td>Nightmare Before Hannukah</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this.</td><td>Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film.</td><td>Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible.</td><td>To be honest....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks.</td><td>Sucks</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever, so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album. I always loved Corea with Farrell, because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe's flutes, sax, etc., like rain drops or storming. Nice soprano. And ELVIN JONES! I put this up up around the \"Joe Farrell Quartet\" album, and Buster William's bass is great, so much I don't miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland. A fresh sound, unparreled even now. It makes me want to see the Outback movie. The album cover is beautiful. Finally, the price is outstanding. Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way.</td><td>return to forever proto-type</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>In two of the episodes, the word \"shut up\" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it.

Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.</td><td>Why so expensive??!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged \"Adam And Evil\"); (2) Deborah Walley's \"girl drummer\" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues \"I'll Be Back\". Everything else is redundant.</td><td>Spun Out</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with \"...lots and lots of girls.\" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way.</td><td>The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>\"Spinout\" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In \"Spinout\" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on \"The Donna Reed Show\". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single.</td><td>Who else would have three beautiful women after him?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Spinout\" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as \"I'll Be Back\" and \"Stop, Look and Listen.\" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie.</td><td>Presley's Worst Film</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include \"Stop, Look, and Listen\" and \"I'll Be Back\".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first.</td><td>The music's better than the movie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway).

I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.</td><td>Piece of junk!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water, as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line.

It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point.</td><td>Works and is easy to use</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an \"assembly required\" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all.

It is a good size, but not overly big in the room. I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase, and not to order the chair separately. I also ordered the matching 3-shelf bookcase, which is a slightly different shade of white, but nothing too noticeable--especially since they aren't by each other. We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily.

The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be \"normal\" desk height for later years, making is a \"Teen\"kraft desk ;-). Thanks.</td><td>Great Value for Less Money</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!</td><td>very nice</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much</td><td>Very Satisfied</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework.

As a \"textbook,\" it has been a complete disappointment. The \"science\" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like \"you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education\" (straight from page 8!). Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from. The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch. In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting \"certified\" in Mr. Jensen's unique, \"empirically unproven\" techniques.</td><td>Multilevel marketing meets education</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more!

The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a \"fad\", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of \"accountability\" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in \"leveling the field\" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of \"survivalists of poverty\". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to \"get off the dead horse\" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century.</td><td>Get off the dead horse of \"old school\" education</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint.</td><td>Easy read for brain information</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:\"Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain\" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?</td><td>Fuzzy around the edges</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book. The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room. Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy.</td><td>Brain Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon.</td><td>Brain based Learning</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff. He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of mid-air, supposedly based on the brain research. If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this, read it carefully. He jumps to conclusions with little to no evidence to back it up. Plus, he is neither a teacher nor a neurologist. He just found something he can write about and sound like an expert. Plus the writing seems written for, we'll, let's say, young readers. Very simplistic, which is not always bad, but in this case, it is.Again, read carefully.

Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties.

The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read.

This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.</td><td>Book of Chance</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.</td><td>Light reading, light in substance</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great CD!!

If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book.

I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the \"dark\" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!</td><td>More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive. I will NOT be buying any further books by this author.

The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes.

Well, now I can't put her books down. Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.</td><td>Patricia Cornwell has turned me into a reader</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always \"one against the world\", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.</td><td>Best of the First Four in this series.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Parricia Corwell, Cruel & Unusual was breathtaking in the beginning!

However, having Adam Sandler in it and seeing the previews in the theater we gave it a (very hopeful) chance. The movie loses it's true premise of having depth in amongst the terrible & crude \"jokes\". I have to say we didn't make it more than 30 minutes into the movie before turning it off. It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.</td><td>I wish Adam Sandler wasn't in this.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird</td><td>Wonderful, baffling mix</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This grill is one of its kind...It can be use anywhere without so much hard work..it fits snugly anywhere....</td><td>No another grill like this...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had never read this author, but knew of many who did. When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work. Now, I pray that the screen does so.I was extremely disappointed with this work. It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope.

I thought the story began well enough, but the ending was lame. The plot was predictable. Lucy is nauseating as ever & wish she'd die. Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.</td><td>Predictable & has a lame ending</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Great racquet!

I am 5'2 size 4 137 lbs before baby and i gained about 35 lbs during pregnancy, just an idea for sizing but keepin mind that everyone has different fat distributions on their bodies. I don't like how my post baby fat was getting pushed up the top and makes me look like I have back boobs. The shape wear crunched up after you sit or bent over and so it doesn't feel smooth all over.

I was able to hook on the first row by myself within about 5 mins max. It wasn't quite as difficult to get on as I thought it might be, although it isn't particularly easy either. I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen.

I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance.

I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6\" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead.

While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.</td><td>WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it.

She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.</td><td>nice product</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.</td><td>Does the job</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind.

There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money.

With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, \"The Custom-House.\" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition.</td><td>This edition is not complete</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The creepiest book I've ever read!

Should a great book not be able to be enjoyed on some level by everyone? To the best of my knowledge, only erudites and scholars enjoy this book. A good book, but one with a limited audience.

Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call \"classics\". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?</td><td>Painful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.</td><td>Great novel</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books</td><td>Horrible reader</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered the Penguin edition for this book five weeks before my grad class started. It was very important to have the correct edition for proper pagination. I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.</td><td>Mistake?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.</td><td>The \"Scarlet\" Letter</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.</td><td>The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages.

This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids.</td><td>Two Tedious Hours</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>god!!! what a dumb movie. the fact that Adam Sandler can do this is just wrong....never lives up to what if true and it down right smells like cheese....sick and demented jokes dont help its premise...though Whitey gets a few lifes...nicely animated but a poor outcome. think of this as a guide beofer watching it...Jon Lovitz, Rob Schneider and others contribute voices.</td><td>one of the worst movies of 2002</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie.</td><td>Fantastic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The movie is vulgar and not meant for children. It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor. Not enjoyable at all.</td><td>very disappointing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running.</td><td>Sandler Strikes Out</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This film has the dubious honor to be included in the book \"The 50 worst films of all time\". It is definently not one of those, but one can hardly call it a proper film, either. It is rather a loose framework in which 12 new songs could be presented in a more or less natural manner. A great-great-grandfather of music videos, and better than some of those!</td><td>Not the worst, but far from good</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have, too, but this isn't it. The translation is very choppy, the singers are medicore at best, and the orchestrations are too overwhelming. \"Love Changes Everything\" is shredded to the point where it hurts to listen to it.Oddly, the best song is the French \"Chanson d'Enfance.\"I was very surprised, as the Japanese usually put out extramely good cast CDS. Their CATS and Phantom and the Tokoyo Evita are all great. But unless you are a total ALW or AOL fanatic, save your money.</td><td>Been waiting for a foreign lauguage AOL CD?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on \"emotional states\" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic.</td><td>It Rises above the \"Fluff\" Books</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was so very pleased to review the art book which arrived in pristine condition.

I think some people don't understand that things sound the way they were MEANT to sound, if they sound poppy, they made it that way, why the hell should they stick to the norm? They want to do something different and in my opinion it sounds great.I can't write a good enough review for this album, all their albums actually, as they are all a masterpiece of their own while still being different enough to keep it interesting. It bugs me when a group doesn't evolve or try new things and stays exactly the same as they ever were, all the time, so I was glad to see them progress and \"grow\".There's too much to say to describe this album, but frankly I don't think I could write a good enough review to do it justice, so I'll just give it my 5 stars :)</td><td>great IMO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>...i had never heard Fair to Midland before hearing this music but cant help making comparisons.

I was a little disappointed in it. It doesn't have alot of stuff going on like with El Cielo which is pretty big compared to Catch Without Arms.

If you are a parent trying to deal with the daily struggles of having a child with a disability, do not read this book. It does not offer any advice for parents, just helps fuel negativitiy. Please do not put yourself through reading this book. If you are still in the grieving stage, this book will not help you. As parents, please try surrounding yourself with positives. Children with disabilities can bring such joy to your life. They can help you learn, help you become more empathetic, help you become stronger, and bring wonderful caring people into your life. Please remember those things when trying to get through this time in your life. Do not waste your time listening to a families stories of frustration, anger, sadness, and embarrassment instead surround yourself with positives.</td><td>WOW!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>One of the 80s rock bands that capture my ears!!!

Well, maybe not Dostoyevsky deepness, but there is quite a lot of depth here, unlike a lot of modern Christmas specials, which are just plugs for toys. The suits at CBS hated this series. They thought it was too intelligent for kids, and they didn't like Vince Guardaldi's jazz score (which is a bonafide classic now). It almost didn't air. Luckily, it did, and we are all better people for it.</td><td>There is no way anyone with a soul could ever give this a negative review....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I do love \"Charlie Brown's Christmas\", a joy for the entire family, young and old. A Christmas play is being directed by Charlie Brown, and everyone is complaining. Charlie is sad because he doesn't know the true spirit of Christmas, and his friend tells him the spirit of Christmas. The play was never finished though.I like this toon because \"Charlie Brown's Christmas\" had the guts to tell about Gabriel telling the shepherds about the Good news that Baby Jesus was born in the manger. I would recommend this to all!</td><td>I ought to slug those R movie loving critics! \"They don't know entertainment\" as Krusty would say</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>One of my favorite Christmas shows of all time! Great service from the provider.</td><td>Charlie Brown Christmas</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - \"Sparky\" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious. One of those films that will never fade out and that are enjoyable beyond the season.</td><td>Proof that good things are built to last</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a classic Christmas tale and was a wonderful gift.

This classic will never die out, as it will be enjoyed for many generations to come.Having always been a huge fan of Charlie Brown to begin with, this is, by far, my favorite Christmas special. I can remember seeing it for the first time like it was yesterday. Charles Shulzz did one amazing job with this classic. This short animated special shows children the true meaning of Christmas, and Linus' delightful explanation is timeless in its teaching.This classic is something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, but especially by families with small children. This is just one great video that would make an excellent addition to anyone's collection.</td><td>The Best Present Of All</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Watched this with my two year old daughter for the first time this Christmas.

Apple still wants to charge an insane price for this last-generation power supply, but luckily Macally has a solution that is almost as nice for about half the price.It does not light up to indicate that it is charging (which is too bad, it was a nice touch).</td><td>Works great, and half the price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4</td><td>This is a good product!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This product works well, with no problems so far. I have now had it for about a month, and it keeps my iBook G4 running with no issues. It doesn't have the light that indicates whether power is being received, but that's a minor thing. Also doesn't have the easy-to-use cable-wrapping things on the original, but once again, that's a mere quibble. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase.</td><td>Quite Satisfactory</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A replacement adapter for my 4-year-old G4 Powerbook was going to cost $80 from Apple. The Macally adapter is less than half the price, and it's built like a tank -- the wires are thicker, and the plastic is more durable. The only thing you might miss is having the yellow/green charging light...but that's more of a luxury and not a necessity. Highly recommended.</td><td>Great product at a great price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color.

I own a 15\" Powerbook G4 (which this is listed as being compatible with).The problem is that this isn't actually a 65watt power cord... so don't expect to use your computer while it's charging... and don't expect to be able to touch the \"brick\" as it's plugged in, you'll burn yourself.I've returned this item and got a charger from another company for just a few dollars more that works a TON better.</td><td>Cheap, Doesn't charge, dangerous, power cord</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I love it, it's LONG and the connection is secure and it doesn't get hot!

It is not the same charger as in the picture with the gray cord. It looks just like most of the other generic chargers available on Amazon. It charges quite slowly (ibook g4 14\").

From now on I will stick with the cheaper generic chargers until my computer is totally dead.</td><td>If you're tempted to throw away $30....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This product is advertised to work with the iBook G4, but it does NOT.This plug looks fine, but despite what the product description stats, it isn't compatible with the 3- to 5-year-old version of the 12-inch iBook G4, which I own and now must buy yet another plug for after this one didn't work.Consider yourself warned.</td><td>Plug DOESN'T work with the iBook G4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Out of the difficult to open package, this adapter worked for a couple of days.I missed the light on the end of the standard Apple adapter (yellow for charging, green for charged).But the price was right, until, it started cycling on and off. The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!).

The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though \"O please get over yourself\". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time.</td><td>Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.</td><td>Disturbing.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper.</td><td>Not Very good</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt/pepper, but there is no such knob on the mini grinders.

Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on.

In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through.

Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that \"we have it in our power to make the world over again\", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing \"We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way\".

I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's \"I Still Miss Someone\" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely \"Will He Be Waiting For Me.\" This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.</td><td>Absolutely incredible</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.)

He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults.

Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about.

As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way.

The text, mixed nicely with the pictures, covers basic information on insects as well as various interesting facts.</td><td>this will interest children in insects</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer.</td><td>Good, but only to the midway point</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>this is not well manufactured i recieved it in a timely manner. but the product is poorly constructed my husbandand i put it together easily but the cotter key to hold on the wheels are made of flimsy material, might as well have been foil. and the screws didn't fit well. i was really disappointed in it.

It didn't even make it through one bag of leaves. I would demand my money back but it would cost too much to send back.

I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended.</td><td>Didactic melodrama</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of \"real life\" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a \"good enough\" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.</td><td>Well, not everything</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This software is not user friendly. The samples don't help. I would imagine that if I sat down for a few hundred hours I could figure out were the dots go. The whole interface just doesn't make any sense. It's very time consuming. Total waste of 30 dollars at the Apple store.</td><td>Software is Horrible!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Easy reading book which I would recommend for those who want a sort of \"executive summary\" of the story behind Wright and his works. Having said this, I found the depth and detail lacking for those who have read extensively about this architect whose noteriety is growing with time. Not for collectors unless you (like myself) want the book to help fill a spectrum of the vast number of publications which continue to come into popular view.</td><td>Biography of Wright and his works</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A bit simplistic at times, but got some good discussions goingin our Sunday School class (Methodist).

The text explaining the theory behind is written like sandpaper and often jumps around leaving important processes out.

My Favorite Muffs albums are Happy Birthday To Me and Alert Today Alive Tomorrow so I like their later material. This Hambuger is a lot of early stuff and some later but I really like it. I think its cronilogical and its interesting to hear how they've improved with time. Good cd!</td><td>This is really cool!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was hoping that this band would have evolved in some or any degree over the past decade, but sadly they have not. Having the courtney love message on this cd is further testament that this band is tapped out. Now that Kim is in her 40s, you'd think there would be more emphasis to release a breakthrough cd rather than these out-takes from the past.</td><td>Very Disappointing.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is structured such that on all the even pages there are a short pithy quotes that summarize the textaul body of the book on the odd pages. The book is written in the style of a manual so that you can dip into it at any point with no need to refer to material that came before.The basic thesis of the book is if you want to enjoy life you have to place one hand on the tiller and steer yourself towards the people, places and things that you like. A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's \"How to get control of time and your life\", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.</td><td>A carefully constructed read.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered two in Cowboy Slim Cut 33x34. I already had some Wranglers. The waist was way too small, the fly was off to my left in a really weird and very ugly and uncomfortable way. These were made in Mexico, just like the ones I bought at Target, but the badging was different, a rubber badge on the back right pocket, not the thin leather Wrangler badge at the rear right waist. Were these knock-offs? Not sure. Returned them and went to Target where I got two pair for $15.99 each (they were Original and Legendary Gold, not Cowboy, but still, half the price, pard)!</td><td>Poor quality and high price... are these knock-offs?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Stockings are not easy to find where I live in Northern California and I cannot stand to wear panty hose. I decided to try these stockings that was recommended by the site I used to find a garter belt. I really like the stockings. They are darker black than the picture depicts them. I prefer off-black. The lace top is a little tight with not too much stretch, so if you have large thighs you might not like them. The next order I will order one size larger for that reason although I do not have large thighs. My husband really likes them and the fact that I like them makes him happy. I will buy more.</td><td>Almost perfect</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>These may look like brushed stainless steel but they are not. The magnet that is glued to the back of these is about 3/8\" and will not hold anything heavier than a very light potholder. I tried hanging an apron on it and it fell to the bottom of the refrigerator. If you are crafty and can remove this tiny magnet and attach a larger, stronger magnet - these hooks will be useful. Otherwise, they are not worth anything. I guess you get what you pay for.</td><td>Not Stainless</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book.</td><td>The meaning of God, the meaning of life.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future.</td><td>What a disappointment!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was expecting a bigger set so was surprised at how small it was. I should have spent more for a better set, but it will have to do for now.</td><td>You get what you pay for.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Don't buy this! Didn't even come with all the screws.

This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia.</td><td>Long Hot Summer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.</td><td>Mathematical nonsense</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought the book because I read the review and it look interesting and funny. But after the first pages, I knew that this was a mistake. Is very repetitive and some of the content really ridiculous for this age and time.</td><td>Boring ...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't really like the book. If the author didn't write the sex portion of the book, there would not have been much to write about. What happened with Nick and the law suit. It was barely mentioned. She could have written more about that and less the descriptive sex.</td><td>Stuck With You</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Awesome.... simply awesome. I couldn't put this down and laughed, smiled, and even got tears! A brand new favorite author.</td><td>None</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was a really fun read. The dialogue was witty and clever. I really enjoyed the progression of the romance. It probably could have been tied up a little sooner. The last 10th of the book kind of drags out the story with storyline that should have been introduced sooner or ended before it was introduced. I do wish more of Nick and Rachel's storyline had been included, just because I enjoyed their banter and potential. I recommend to any modern romance fan.</td><td>Witty and clever.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!</td><td>Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>First thing I noticed about this book was that the pages were stuck together. No, really...they were. The printer did not get it right when they cut the edges of this book. There were many pages that had to be hand cut just to TURN them. I could not stand the ... design. Then, once I get everything readable, I find that the information herein is, oh, about 15 years old and totally useless for current midi applications.MIGHT be ok if you are looking for a history of midi and want to spent an hour making the book readable by cutting the uncut pages so that you can actually READ them.</td><td>lousy, outdated guide, with horrible printing flaws!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am still yet to receive these items that I purchased 4 months ago.

I was pleasantly surprised when I read it in one sitting, twice! You will not want to put this one down.LBW is simple, yet romantic. The story originates in Africa with childhood friends, Jacques and Margaret. Margaret moves to London and weds Lord Berkley. When the childhood friends return to Africa, the storytelling becomes richer. Even when they are separated by continents, decades, and lovers, Jacques and Margaret maintain a sweet friendship.This is a must read that is well-written and culturally enlightening.</td><td>Big things in small package</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The base and frame were not completely attached.

I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the \"ON\" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the \"OFF\" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.</td><td>Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Somehow, if I had spent the time reading the book a little before purchasing, I wouldn't have bought it.

Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.</td><td>LIvely Experimental Synthesizer Jazz with Global Fusion</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>IT'S OLD SCHOOL JAMS!!!

The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.</td><td>I do not recommend this vacuum</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of \"Billy the Kid\" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.</td><td>More Fiction than fact</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Squiggler fell apart at second use, with no way to put the prongs back into the base. This is a worthless piece of junk!

I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn't seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless.

However, this book claims that only the overweight or people with eating disorders lack self-confidence. It is not true, obviously. I am not overweight and never had any eating disorders, but I just don't have a positive self-image. So if you're like me, don't read this book. I couldn't relate to it.

Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.</td><td>Typical Thomas video, all about James</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand \"new\" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged).

In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching.

If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, \"Skylarking\" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for \"Apple Venus\". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (\"Frivolous Tonight\") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts \"River of Orchids\" and \"Green Man\".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (\"Knights in Shining Karma\"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material.

The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift.

However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: \"Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever.\" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that \"Lifetimes\" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.</td><td>Effective book for discussing physical death with a child</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ra has to be one of the most underrated band in rock music.When I heard their first cd I was blown away. These guys are amazing. The whole feel of this band is just is so different than anything I have heard in many years. This cd is really good and I would hope the world would sit up and take notice.These guys are talented musicians and in modern music that can be rare.The music is angery and powerful and then it is smooth and melodic.Tell Me, I lost everything today,The only one, and got me going are some of the ones that stand out to me.The cover of the Police's \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\" is one of the more interesting covers I have ever heard.If you liked \"From One\" the buy this disc. I would love to see these guy live.</td><td>Great band even better now</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Is this the current state of scholarship at the Academy today??

Granted, Angel is dead, but he's still related to her and definately should NOT be trying to catch his own cousin. Ewww. To top off the wrongness that is this book, there is barely any mention of vamps and stuff. Also, this is a 'coming of age' story about how being popluar isn't the most important.

I could quibble with some things in the lyrics which are not quite in line with the lore, but overall I find the music both pleasant and inspiring.This CD draws upon Scandinavian folk music for inspiration for its melodies. With the exception of one track, the lyrics are in English. The lead singer, Andrea Nebel Haugan, can actually sing! Professionally done and melodic.Many of my non-Heathen friends also enjoy listening to this CD.</td><td>Impressive</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This small gem of a book can be appreciated not only from a modern poetic viewpoint but also from a philosophical standpoint as a comment on integrating pure creativity into our everyday motions.

Instead, this meandering book comprises \"hick\" UFO sightings that are only infrequently connected with Mothman, and Keel's trust-me-I- know-what-I'm-talking-about theories and explanations. I was particularly dismayed by seemingly endless accounts of men (in black) behaving badly. With little to recommend it (and aside from providing some details on the Mothman sightings, there's no other recommendation), \"The Mothman Prophecies\" is a considerable disappointment.</td><td>Not What I'd Hoped For</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Let me just start by saying that the \" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES\" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole.

This book's are, albeit only in the beginning. After a while you'll begin to wonder if the author wanted to portray himself as a paranoid schizophrenic or if that's just a side effect of the complete lack of organization and logic in his writing style.This book wasn't worth the time--or the title.

I thought it would provide a photographic history of perhaps the 1930's and 1940's. I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's.</td><td>A wish to time travel to 1880's Rockaway.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As a 27 year old man from the UK, I was stunned by how this record took me back to bike rides along the beach in a simpler time (which was quite frankly, before my time).

Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.</td><td>Repetitive and monotone</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This has got to be one of the most depressing books I have ever read. Not depressing in the sense that the tone of the book was depressing (which it was), but depressing in the sense that it was such poor quality.

I am pretty sure I won't be reading any other books by Jamaica Kincade.</td><td>Worst book I've ever read</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I first heard about this book, I wonderded if it was going to be a new story or a continuation. Fortunately, a continuation.I had read reviews about the book here and after the local library did not ever have a copy in sock, I bought it. I read it in 4 days, reading each night after work. I can say it was a good read. Steady flowing action, no real dull moments, no unnecessary story lines, etc. I was not disappointed at all.I gave it only 4 stars, much for the same reason others have, the ending was rushed and abrupt. But, never fear, there is to be 3 more books before the real ending. So, we all have something to look forward to.This is only the second Koontz book I have read, so I was unable to distinguish where he was writing and the other author was writing. More die hard Koontz fans may be able to tell the difference.So, overall a good, smooth, never dull, read.

Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these.</td><td>Love these glasses</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot!

There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word \"ficbe\" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me.

Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing.

This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.</td><td>Small type</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>In the forest of Midworld, one had better learn to hug close to one's home tree or risk being killed by innumerable plants, animals, insects, and other beings less well categorized.Yet, despite a living space defined by various levels of Hell below and above, this planet accommodates a small group of humans who succeeded in adapting to its rigors. Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself.

I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.</td><td>Cruel and Depressing Story</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tess was a very boring book. From an analytical point, the book's major theme was FATE. However, you must be interested in the victorian era, in order to enjoy the book.

She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again.

Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.</td><td>Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: \"The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential.\"</td><td>Please read Kundera's book instead</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The unbearable lightness of being is the ability to give your body without becomimg emotionally involved. This is no problem for the hero of this film, but it is a wrenching experience for the heroine, who believes in emotional and physical fidelity to her mate, and cannot change her feelings.

And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read \"On The Road\", \"The Town and The City\", and just before this one, \"The Subterraneans\", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer.</td><td>Prose-Poetry to inspire</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car.</td><td>On the Road To Enlightenment</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.</td><td>Flat Kerouac</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The operative word from the title is \"bums\".

If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd).</td><td>1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I mean, this was never the greatest movie ever, but I own the other two so logically i had to have this one.

You really ought to find something else to do with your time. Sure wish I did.</td><td>Horrible</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>By most accounts, the Michael Bay-directed Transformers films to date are not very good, but that hasn't stopped them from making gobs and gobs of cash, and this third installment, Dark of the Moon, made the most of them all. This time around, Sam Witwicky and the Autobots must race to recover and protect an ancient Autobot ancestor who crash landed on the moon, but the Decepticons interfere, and things aren't exactly as they seem. I found Dark of the Moon to be an improvement over the second installment, with some impressive special effects work and action sequences, but the film as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. Don't expect to find much more to the movie than \"Ooh, big robots and explosions!\" But hey, for some, that's really all you need.</td><td>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck.</td><td>The movie itself is ok, the streaming for it was crap.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life.</td><td>The perfect movie, for a 12 yr old</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.Fission MailedWhere to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as \"immature\" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his forté and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.</td><td>Lights out on this awful film</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The first transformers movie will always be the best one, and its just ok. The movies too long jumping back and forth, very poorly constructed.</td><td>Not that great</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description.</td><td>Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Great movie but no special features on it. Once I opened that movie I noticed that there is a $10off coupon for the 3D version that is coming out with special features.</td><td>Love this movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The plot/storyline was not cohesive. The movie is way too long with the characters not really coming to life. Making a movie longer is not making a movie better. In fact, if the movie is weak, making it longer just makes the point even more (painfully) obvious.I kept watching the movie to see if it would improve but unfortunately that was not the case.Maybe DreamWorks will just move on to another project.Save your money if you intend to buy. Better rent and save the rest for a better movie.</td><td>Could have been MUCH better and shorter</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie. It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots. Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens. Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.</td><td>Review of Transformers:Dark of the Moon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A pure joy to watch with its many special effects.

This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.</td><td>Guys Movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was very excited to see this movie available on Amazon Prime, but I was disappointed once I started watching. I really couldn't stand Sam's new model girlfriend. She was so annoying and spends most of the film posing and pouting prettily. I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar. Of course, I must admit that maybe it would have been clearer if I had followed more of the Transformers cartoon. Another big flaw was in the long action sequence involving a glass building. There's foreshadowing when the NASA guy announces that they're going to be taking refuge in a glass building.

That you will have to fast forward past some things. But Transformers, that advertise a kids theme, sold as toys at stores, can be find in MacDonald happy meals. So you would think the movie be for kids. But it not. They focus more on Sam and love gal then what the robots story. Forget Sam, the name of the movie is TRANSFORMERS.I rate this movie 1star...love the CGI for the robots. But you barley seen the robots. The whole movies is about Sam and his love interest. Michael Bay need to hang this up and give it to a true comic fan who can direct a movie about TRANSFORMERS...pitiful</td><td>Thought transformers suppose to be for kids....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>As another reviewer noted these do not pierce cloth well at all so were basically useless for me.

Surprised, and a little disappointed in my own taste, but anyway...You know exactly what to expect from this movie. Explosions, Fighting...and that's it. Luckily, it delivers both of those in spades, especially the 'splosions. I have never seen so many things blow up. Every fifteen minutes John Cena barely escapes some building blowing up. And in slow motion, of course. The story is Kelly Carlson is kidnapped by Robert Patrick and John Cena must rescue her.Robert Patrick is plain fantastic in this flick. The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully. Plus, he's a hottie so...Overall, just an easy, cheesy, blow-em-up, action B-movie. The extras are pretty lame, though.</td><td>B-Movie-Licious</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Might actually watch this if Cena wasn't in it, if his acting is any worse than his wrestling persona this will be his last movie.*Update:Marine II will star Ted Dibease HAHAHAHAHAHAH LOL!!!! pathetic.</td><td>Hell no.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie really is a complete stinkpot.The acting is horrible,the action is way too over the top and unbeleivable,and the comedy is way too stupid and cheesy. First off the movie gets started in a crazy action scene/war flashback. No story what so ever. The car chase scene is so full of it, a car gets shot with a high powered rifle like 500 times and is still driving around. Even the twist at the end was completely easy to figure out. Please avoid this reeking exploding crock of ....</td><td>What a complete and utter waste of time, and money.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I've had many problems with Sony computer items before, but I thought I'd give this one a try. After being on the phone with Sony (who didn't even know what the emarker was) for over four hours, I still can't the thing to work. There's some problem with the program you download from emarker.com. The program has problems loading the emarker USB drive into your computer. Thus, you can't use it at all. If I were you, I'd wait till they develop this product further and work out all the problems. Sony told me they would pass my problem on to the Research and Development team, who would try to get back to me as soon as they can (I hope this team knows what the product is!)As for me, I plan on returning my emarker today.</td><td>Please Listen to Me...Don't buy this product!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent Product, but Sony is taking down the support for the product at the end of Sept so don't bother buying. Shame as it was really good while it lasted.</td><td>Sony E-Marker is now obsolete</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.</td><td>good idea, good looks, needs lots of work</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.</td><td>Totally Useless</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to \"enable\" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.</td><td>worthless</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.</td><td>Another thingabob on a key chain</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Use of the eMarker depends on the eMarker website. However, Sony has just announced that they are discontinuing the website, and so eMarker devices will now be useless.

Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real.

The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person.

The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to \"freestyle\" and \"improvisation\". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy.</td><td>Disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The shoe seemed nice.

That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive \"pamphlet\" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.</td><td>Buy the 1993 version instead.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>All of Paxton Quigleys self protection books are written for women but are in general excellent advice for both sexes.

Dare I say Sara Miles carries the movie more than the David Lean imprint and the obnoxiously heavy-handed score?</td><td>Viewed it yesterday</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean.</td><td>Ryan's Revenge</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie.

Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?</td><td>Am I missing something?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Puss in Boots is a wonderful story.

However, I do put forward a challenge to \"rtbarry\" in AZ to move beyond his very own drivel masquerading as a \"review\", if he is capable, to explain in detail what in his opinion is lacking in this CD that rates it only one star?

I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid! His actions obviously mean nothing, but she'll listen to what he says--wham--bam!Terrible, just terrible!</td><td>O-o-okay</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book.</td><td>Heads above the first book in the trilogy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history.</td><td>Good book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan.</td><td>Fantastic Sci Fi Classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change.</td><td>Phenomenal</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.</td><td>Good politics, but no science</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books.</td><td>Asimow is one of the best writers of all times</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!</td><td>Classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Prelude to Foundation is excellent. However, you should stop there. Foundation is bad. This book is totally predictable. Read DUNE if you want something intelligent and entertaining. Read FOUNDATION if you want something that you probably won't even finish.</td><td>Don't Bother</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!</td><td>tough going</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story.</td><td>Dissatified</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print.

Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?</td><td>Great Writing</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (\"Welcome to Mongolia!\" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.</td><td>If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say \"nearly,\" because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties.

First I will start with the movie, brilliant! That is all there is to be said about the film. Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!</td><td>Amazing Score.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this.

But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop.

A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \"The Road Warrior.\" And \"The Road Warrior\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.\"Mad Max\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the \"action hero\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.</td><td>This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'</td><td>Great DVD packed with a ton of features!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read.

I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song \"Revolution 9\" from the \"White Album.\" I could've just imagined while listening to \"Baby Lulu\" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)</td><td>Oh, my God!

His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia.

The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation.

As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual \"guide.\" The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects.

In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.</td><td>Persuasive book with an unusual approach</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.</td><td>Another Sensual Gem from this Composer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Works great. Just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc.

It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc.</td><td>You'll enjoy this CD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical. She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of \"Lament\" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality. While in the song \"Beuonos Aires\" she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention. She is a great actor. If I could change one thing it would be to switch Jimmy Nail and Jonathin Pryce because Nail should sing more songs and Price should sing less.</td><td>Madonna is a great singer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>All I can say is wow! I never thought Madonna could sing like this. Now I am a huge fan of hers. Antonio Banderas's accent makes him fit the part of Che very nicely. The songs are incomparable.

It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height.

They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is \"save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on\", that's what we're doing now.</td><td>Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this air mattress after researching the site.

We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.</td><td>Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The air mattress does blow up in seconds. It is comfortable. It is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money. My daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night.</td><td>Works well</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.</td><td>Great for the summer</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump.</td><td>Quick and Easy</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We recently moved into a smaller place. When my parents came into town, they took my oldest sons room. We needed something for him to sleep on but didn't have much room. This twin airbed by Intex is great! I love the fact that the pump is built in. It doesn't get in the way like I thought it might. My son says it's very comfortable. It's easy to inflate and deflate.</td><td>Love it</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I needed to replace my airbed but didn't want to spend a fortune. This one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones I found in my local bed and bath store.</td><td>Great Find at a Great Price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud.</td><td>Its better then a \"normal\" bed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.</td><td>Electric pump failed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Durable and EXTREMELY comfortable. Loses a little air over extended use, but adding air very easy.</td><td>Excellent product for the price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I am in Iraq and this mattress is great. It is 100x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here.</td><td>great mattress</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.</td><td>Would not recommend</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night.</td><td>Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I love this air mattress so much. It is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too. It is very sturdy and durable as well. Over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone's place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself</td><td>The Best Air Mattress EVER!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bought the Intex pillow rest for visits/visitors. Inflation is quick, quiet and easy. Deflation works the same. Slight loss of air by early morning. Fits back into tote nicely, take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric, fold in thirds length wise, then role from bottom toward pump/pillow end. Easy to tote and store.</td><td>Fantastic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!</td><td>Better than the Queen size bed</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have been a fan of Step Rideau and the Zydeco Outlaws since I purchased their CD \"Standing Room Only.\" \"I'm So Glad\" has quickly become my favorite. Some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco. This is a \"must buy\" for zydeco lovers. If the Grammys had a catagory for zydeco, Step would win for performer of the year.</td><td>Step's Best Work So Far!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I paid 95 at comp usa (known for being overpriced) over a year ago.anyways, The case doesn't get the best air so I'd recommend getting more fans.If you have problems with the front USB hubs (pc freezes when you plug something in them), unplug the very BOTTOM black wire.[r|r][w|w][g|g][b|b][b|[]</td><td>200 bucks?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Very good comprehensive review on The Band.

Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.</td><td>No way!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money.</td><td>Not worth the money</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>For those wondering, like myself, this DOES come in a discrete package. Now, as for the actual product? OMG I've never felt something like this before. This is my first official toy, and I am sooooo pleased! It's a little large, and kinda hard but that's okay. Works wonderfully. I would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</td><td>GREAT prodct</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was much bigger then I had anticipated, that being my own fault. But the reason I gave it only 1 star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt! The bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable. So my man suggested I turn it around and then my taint became irritated! Not one bit pleased with this product.</td><td>Awful</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product.</td><td>Too big!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the \"bunny ears\" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product.</td><td>Awful!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!</td><td>HATE IT!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum \"my first vibrator\" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more \"lifted\" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!</td><td>Fantastic (and FAST!)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.</td><td>After 6 years, this album is still awesome.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.</td><td>I'm glad I didn't pay for it.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.</td><td>Great book!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her \"dialouges\" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like \"Evergreen\" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), \"The Music of the Night\" , & \"Somewhere\" (not favorable with Il Divo)</td><td>Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...</td><td>Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the \"too good to be true\" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.</td><td>misleading photo</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!</td><td>Waste of money</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.</td><td>What a waste!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 \"generations\" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.</td><td>Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.</td><td>Confused</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.</td><td>Great deliver of all products</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.</td><td>Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.</td><td>Oh Romeo</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.</td><td>A good introduction to the tragedies.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!</td><td>RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.</td><td>Good book -- but not this edition</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!</td><td>How do films like this get made?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!</td><td>What the Heck ???</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better.</td><td>Cute, But a Little Cheap...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order.

So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!</td><td>no color, no buy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!</td><td>Not classic Yello - but very very good!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? \"Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!\"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!</td><td>Disappointed!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson \"in his own words\" but were nothing more than fabrication.</td><td>A double edged sword</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,\"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook.\"The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.</td><td>MANSON HATES EMMONS.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.</td><td>Lies, Lies, Lies</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said \"man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system\" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td><td>REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.</td><td>I couldn't put it down</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.</td><td>sadly predictable</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I struggled through this book.

There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.</td><td>A unique take on a classic theme</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing \"object\" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years.

This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call \"The Three V's.\" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.</td><td>Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!</td><td>Buyer Beware!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.</td><td>This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The \"auto\" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.</td><td>Worst scanner I've owned.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>In \"The Greengage Summer\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing.

Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book</td><td>Great Book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the \"natural disaster\" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp.

Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (\"limited\" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider \"fixing\", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone.</td><td>Yet another broken headphone jack.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as \"Discontinued\". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.</td><td>Discontinued 70PD05500032?</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I own several dozen Christmas Jazz CD's.

But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: \"Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)\".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD.</td><td>Wow</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Ok, as yall might know me, im Gamer8. To the game. This game is sorta like the first NBA Street game for the PS2. It has some flaws, such as lighting. Also, at points of the game, you might say, is this game worth $50.00? Well, its worth about $30.00. 1.- Its not a good game for portability. 2.- Lighting is bad at times 3.-Can be hard for beginners.

The show is fantastic, but both Dolby Digital and DTS version of this DVD have one of the worst sounds I ever heard. My subwoofer didn't move once while the tweeters of the front speakers nearly went on flames. More, the soundtrack was re-edited with sound taken from other concerts (that's incredible - at one moment I swear that I heard the word Munchen despite the fact that the concert is in Amsterdam).

However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device.</td><td>It does not use your classification for the musics.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought a sansa e280 for myself and have not encountered any troubles, so I decided to buy a View for my boyfriend.

Thats where trouble came. For video and pictures, you have to convert the file format by using the sansa downloadable converter. I was able to transfer photos with no problem but we never were able to get video on the player. We tried different files, different computers, and different people and nothing.

However he has more than one style of writing. This book is in an experimental style more related to Rabelais, Cervantes, Voltaire, Swift and Sterne. This book set in \"Joe's World\" is the second book in this series. Although not main stream in any way it is an enjoyable book and well worth reading.

Watching them ride will inspire all of you mountain biking enthusiast out there. As the description states, this is about the riders and sacrifices they go through, not about their riding skill and extreme stunts. I expected non-stop action, but this is still a great DVD to add to my collection.

Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a \"great\" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.</td><td>Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision.

Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you.

They fit my ear canal perfectly, negating the need for the ear loop that came with it. Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset.

I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.</td><td>Very BORING</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go.</td><td>Birds, Beasts and Relatives</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Quite often, bringing a classic story like \"Moby Dick\" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!).

I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.</td><td>Great Series opener</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Since I started somewhere in the middle of the series, this book was the explanation of who Monk was and about his accident in which he lost his memory.

There was no one here who was 'real' enough to care about. The people all felt like shadows, without true substance (or reasons) to their actions. I couldn't find reasons to cheer for anyone.

I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done.

As a romantic comedy, it falls short on both romance and comdey. As a movie trying to give over a lesson, it is trite, overdone, and poorly performed.

She has her hopes and dreams for what her life will become. Little does she know she will get exactly what she asks for. However, as in true life, it may not be in the way you expect it.A truly, inspirational movie for anyone struggling through some tough times in your life.

You are introduced to boring characters, cliched camera angles and material we all know John Mcteirnan is far more capable of. I was thankful I got to rent this instead of buying it because quite frankly this movie just plain stinks! If you really want to see the real \"Rollerball\" rent (don't buy) the original. The original has a much stronger story and for cryin out loud-James Caan! He's a legend man!!

DO NOT BUY!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had high hopes for this movie.I actually thought it would be at least a little bit decent.It wasn't.It was pure garbage.I had to leave this movie after the first 30 minutes.Its that bad.Avoid this movie at all costs.</td><td>Horrible.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would.</td><td>ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie should have never been made, there is basically no story present and is just a bunch of people going around on rollerblades bashing each other's brains in. I was really looking foreword to this flick, it's previews were misleading, it looked as though it was brilliant and exciting. Guess what, it's really really really NOT!Trust me don't waste your time unless the only thing better you have to do is give the cat a bath, even then I really don't believe you should waste your time!</td><td>Junk, need I say more JUNK</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I ordered this, based on the reviews. I ordered on 11/16, and received it on 11/21 (I needed it by 11/29). I love the musky smell. I only tested 1 drop on my wrist. I have to say that after a couple of hours, the smell turned into a strong sex smell... not bad, but definitely sex. I'm going to test it out at work next week, but the real test is on 11/30. I'll report my findings then.12/6/12: It works! This is definitely going to be my \"go-to\" scent. It drove my man crazy! I love it. I will purchase again.</td><td>I Hope I'm Not Allergic To It!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book has been a great help to us as we work with our Russian guests.

What will this do for you. All it does is make noises. Have you looked at the price of the item and do you think it is a good price for something that does nothing, but make a noise and just sits there after one day of being played with? This has no education value. For Yu-Gi-Oh fans, you should try buying Yu-Gi-Oh tins instead of this CRAP!</td><td>What the????</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I bought two of the 633's two years ago and actually fell in love with the machine - despite the TV Guide debacle (blame cable companies on that, not the manufacturers). After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives. I am waiting until pioneer replaces this line (533/633) to buy a better one. Don't know why there is so little to choose from in the industry for this type of product.</td><td>When Good Products Go Bad</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again.</td><td>Very disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>These run VERY large and do not fit correctly because of this. However, for the price, I still think they are a great bargain. They are very heavy duty and will probably last many years. They are also very warm. Almost too warm here in southen California. Those people in cold climates would LOVE them! Anyhow, I would be giving five stars except for the mismatched fit. But I just tucked it in really good and they stay on the bed just fine.</td><td>Very large</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dont get it the graphics suck and u can only get mega man.

You have to shake it forever before it will even do anything. I thought it was broken at first but then I found out that you can shake it for 10 min and nothing will happen but that's normal. If you like Megaman then I'd get the GBA game instead of the PET toy.</td><td>Not a good toy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>JBL has several price points for it's professional sound reinforcement products. JRX is the least expensive and MRX is the second least expensive. The MRX series offer higher quality and durability for a very reasonable price. These are normally $700.00 each. Amazon offered a new \"opened\" package which I was able to purchase for much less. These are extremely lightweight for the amount of power they can handle. Power handling is between 400 and 1600 watts depending on the program. Nominal wattage is 800 watts into 8 ohms. Excellent for live monitoring or as mains for smaller venues. Speakon in and out connectors only. Non protruding handle. Great product.</td><td>JBL MRX512M</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I can't believe this rates higher than 2 Stars.

Having once recognized Pratchetts works, I left all my classic German literature aside and started reading and reading and reading... . But this book, \"Small Gods\", has beaten everything I've read before (even my all-time favorite \"Faust\" - you know: the Goethe one). It is witty, intelligent and above all deaply questioning. I remained nodding all the time:\"Yes, that's what I always believed religion is about.\"</td><td>Pratchetts Best!!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I've been trying to distill my reviews to seventeen syllables. Here's an attempt.A tortoise falls fromthe sky.

My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious. I, however, am left wondering: why?I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors. The characters are boring and flat. His humor is downright stupid. This book is not clever in the least. If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel. But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.</td><td>Why do people like this garbage?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I liked what it was about, the characters and alot of the ideas. What I didn't like was the plot, it just bored me. The only reason I kept reading was to see if it had anymore ideas in it, I love his ideas, especially in books like Mort, Colour of Magic, and Light Fantastic.</td><td>Boring plot.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great \"silent damage\" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet.</td><td>cross contamination</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have read the other reviews of this book, and while I appreciate everyone's opinions I must say that this book helped me immensely! I am new to the gluten free life. I have been ill for two years and am just finding out that gluten is one of my issues. I had NO prior knowledge and this book did a lot to allay my fears. I haven't read Against the Grain, so I cannot compare the two. Jax made me laugh often, even through my tears. I recommend it for those just starting out.</td><td>Just Accepting Gluten Free Life</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My sister was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease and there is a strong chance that I may have it as well. I wanted to read about it to learn more and was told that this book was a great place to start. Unfortunately, I found the book to be poorly written and with the most bizarre suggestions; how to write your family a Christmas letter, informing them of the diagnosis. Come on! There are other instances that I felt it was just a little over the top and was not realistic to everyday life.Since finishing this book, I began reading Elizabeth Hasselbeck's book, The G-Free diet and have found it to be much more informative and much better written. Ms. Hasselbeck's book gets right to the point giving you the information that you really need to understand this disease.</td><td>Terrible!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Most of the people who gave shining, sparkly reviews of this book focus on how it made them feel. It is not boring. Jax is a talented writer, I'll give her that. But when I read on page 394 that the perscription drugs I was on and had been on for 5 years (both Pfizer drugs) were not GF I was seriously troubled.Many follow-ups with both Pfizer and online support groups have indicated just how full of erroneous information this book is.I went off my meds immediately thinking I was injesting gluten. I suffered the undue consequences of going off \"cold turkey\" when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book. If you want some comfort and laughs then give it a read, but be sure to take any factual information with a grain of salt, as they say.Jax was indeed very lax when writing this book.</td><td>get the facts</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>What a wonderful, easy book to read. And so helpful. So many books and articles on this subject are just too plain technical and boring to read. Not the Gluten-Free Bible. It is clear, easy-to-understand and very engaging. I really appreciate how the author relates the issues of living gluten-free to everyday life. It is an intelligent book that is fun to read and very, very informative at the same time. I have never written a book review before, but I am so impressed with The Gluten-Free Bible that I want to share these thoughts with everyone and I intend to rush out to buy the other books by this insightful, witty writer.

There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. \"Raising Your Spirited Child\" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child. I am saddened and more than a bit annoyed (I purchased the book on the basis of the organization's recommendation) that the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry would put its imprimatur on a book containing such little insight.</td><td>Devoid of depth or even much substance</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I picked up this book at B&N; because I had just read two Jane Austin novels and I thought this would be a light read. I was wrong. The beggining and the end had a purpose in the story but the middle could have been much, much shorter and the ending made a little longer.I liked the character of Mr. Bounderby. He was very well developed. I would even say over-developed, but he was the only one. How did Sissy influence the youngest Gradgrind? Why didn't we know of Mrs. Bounderbys inner turmoil till she ran to her father? Every character had something missing. What happened to Mr. Bounderby once he was found out? Why is Sissy so special and what did she really do for the family?It was a long book where nothing much happened until the last quarter and when it finally ended I felt cheated because it lacked a complete story line and full characters. The story line could have been forgiven if I was more satisfied with the characters.</td><td>Try something else.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Charles Dickens, as is his custom, slams into so-called civilized 19th century British industrial scenes in a smoky place called Coketown.

For several reasons: 1. the hero Ben seemed weak especially when he allowed his mother to slap him, come on he is like 37-39 years old!!!

Utilizing a stunning mixture of layered guitar melodies, gloomy synths, and thunderous percussion, Varg works his way through three hypnotic metal songs before the ambitious ambient outro - Tomhet. Rather than sit here and rattle on about the magic contained within this record, I would rather just claim that it is a must have for any black metal fan, and ranks among the highest calibur or metal releases period.</td><td>A Must Have</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>An excellent book. Kim Newman puts his own spin on a turn around a Wold Newton style universe. He also has a bunch of sneaky 'now who was that' style cameos, a la John Myers Myers' Silverlock.Dracula has found another way to be in charge in England, by marrying in to the royal family. To prevent problems, he has had the Great Detective thrown in a prison camp.So when a serial killed called Silver Knife is killing vampire whores, it falls to the Diogenes Club to investigate. Vampires heal normal wounds, but not silver. The investigation uncovers a lot more than just a chain of killings.</td><td>Super Reader</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.</td><td>Politics?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a great reference for anyone considering using handguns as self-defense. Even experienced people should have a book like this as a refresher and reference. Is it perfect? No, such a short book is only so comphrensive.

I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally \"twisted\".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one.</td><td>Lousy Camera</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way.

The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing \"Jamie\", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: \"My World is Empty Without You\" and \"Forever Came Today\". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!</td><td>Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I really have to give this author credit, as far as being able to be so objective in writing about her cousin's killers, and the police detectives who forced a confession from her innocent brother. The book presents its facts on the case, leaving us to our own conclusions. What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read.</td><td>Great true crime read</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static. I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices, speakers and headphones, and all have the same result, static. Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved. Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $3 shipped to begin with.</td><td>static central</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>EDIT: I updated this review in response to comments and changes in the product description.When I purchased the cable the product photo showed gold-plated connectors, and existing reviews (Jose Lima 2007, Larkenfield 2007) mentioned separately insulated wires and gold-plated connectors, so that's what I originally thought I was going to get.The cable I received had nickel-plated connectors; it did not have separately insulated wires. It worked, but the sound started cutting out after less than a month and I've long since thrown the cable away.Given at least one other reviewer of this product (Joseph Z. Singer 2012) didn't get what they expected based on the product description, I think it's safe to say that the product photo and the descriptions of the product in all but the most recent reviews is unreliable. If I were you, I'd buy from another shipper.</td><td>I expected something better</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first \"click\" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones.</td><td>Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I've studied philosophy to a good degree and therefore and to read some of Freud's work in Philosophy of Psychology. While making some entertaining remarks, Freud has now long been discounted as anything valid and understandably so.</td><td>Freud is crazy!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work.</td><td>If life is a dream, then don't wake me up</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ordered it. It arrived quickly. It is used and is as described . I'll update whenever I read it. d</td><td>It arriived</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Freud's \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory.</td><td>Barely Unbeatable Theory</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Grandma and a brother?

Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here.

Not unlike some of the other reviewers I too was on my way to Boston on business whilst reading this \"glued to my seat\" book. For the first time, I can say that I was pleased for all the flight delays as I managed to finish reading this book on route. I am an avid reader and can say without reservation that Rapid Descent was easily as good as any of the books being written by some of the better known authors, such as Crichton, Grisham, Cook etc to name a few of my favorites.

BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key.</td><td>Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My husband and I got more out of this than the free classes the hospital nurses give. We've been able to watch it over for things we missed. There is tons of useful information...too much to take in at once. I love having it becasue if I forget something I just re-watch that section. Its helped us become familar with the terms the nurses use and we have great information for question asking when we go to our Dr. Apts.</td><td>Great Information</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I really enjoyed this DVD, it provided good content at a nice pace.

I'm a former labor and delivery nurse. The videos were purchased for my daughter who is expecting her first child this summer. The videos were extrememly ionformative and great fun to watch!

Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest.</td><td>TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!</td><td>GO FOR IT!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>After I bought this DVD, I watched it about 8 times on my own and with my husband before our son was born. We both laughed at Sheri's mannerisms but really loved all we learned from her. We both felt more prepared, even though we weren't able to attend birthing classes.</td><td>LOVED this video!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was going for a med-free birth...not for any reason other than I wanted to because my mom did it with my sisters and I and I figured I could do it as well. It's what our bodies are meant to do, right? Well, this DVD was great! It saved me from paying over $100 for a lamaze class and I felt the stuff she touched on for the lamaze section was perfect. I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It's a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class. (I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, b/c they should really look into updating it soon).</td><td>RECOMMEND!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Thank goodness I borrowed this from the public library and didn't waste my money. My husband and I did attend live classes, but wanted a refresher before the big event.

I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in \"Revenge\". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, \"got-nothing-else-to-do\" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right.

You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE! That should be on the back cover or in a disclaimer somewhere. Not Recommended.</td><td>This book is AWEFUL</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I first picked up this book (some 8 years ago) I was initially put off by the thickness of it. But once I started reading I was totally hooked.The strong, self-assured and intellegent female character was truely refreshing. I have given this book to my sisters and to several friends. And whenever I get into a discussion about 'good books' this is one of the books I bring up and strongly encourage every I know to read.Today I have come to shop for this book so that I might send it to a pen-pal in West Africa.

That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!</td><td>one of the best series EVER!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The blue portion of the mats was a different blue.

This is reminiscent of mediocre late 80's trash metal, with all songs sounding the same. Mid-paced tempos and simplistic solos abound, with moronic wayyyyy-out-of-date pretend-satanic lyrics and cartoony cover art. Just dumb, dumb, dumb. Want real thrash metal, aside from the Big Four?

I give this album four stars, because, though I love this album and this band, Five stars would mean it's an album that stands next to Physical Graffitti, the White Album, and a select few other records. This album is a must own for fans who enjoy any of the splinter disciplines of what Sabbath, Hendrix, and Zeppelin started. An album worth the money, with many great songs and performances. If there are any criticisms, one would be the production. It leaves some room for improvement. Beyond that, I hope this band can continue to build upon this awesome release for years to come.

All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West.

The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film.</td><td>Flyboys</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have enjoyed watching \"Flyboys\" several times. The special effects are outstanding and very lifelike. One of the features that I really enjoyed was watching the bonus features at the end.

This book explains new insight on Jesus' parables, taking in consideration of the Lord's geographical location and culture.It took me a while to read this book. Why? Because this is the type of book that you may want to meditate after reading it. Its not something that you read and let bygones be bygons.This book particularly focuses on what our actions should be as Jesus' followers. It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God.</td><td>Thank God</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Just another one of those movies. A bunch of young kids travelling somewhere and get cut up into pieces because some psycho wants their organs. Neither scary nor educational(Tommy, you are taking Anatomy 101, and believe me, this movie doesn't help you pass that class!). Many scenes are too dark to tell what happened.

Also, these discs are absolutely barebones, only featuring a Dolby 2.0 soundtrack and a 1.85:1 widescreen presentation. Where are the extras?!

This guy cant sing! later on his album came along, his vocals destroy his tracks, literally. Comparing him to other artists such as Mario or 112, you'll realize that he can't sing, full stop. Disappointing.</td><td>What's this?...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Thank God he stopped rapping, but now this album sucks too! Glad it was free. He's reppin' Cali too- oh hell no! The crazy thing is he tried working with some new and other producers like R. Kelly and Timberland and they did him wrong! There are only three tight songs numbers 3, 4 and 5, all were produced by Rodney Jerkins, he can't be his sister though, this album proves Ray J just ain't got it, maybe he could if he had just stuck with using Rodney Jerkins. But the beats are not supposed to make you tight, your supposed to make that beat what it is and more.</td><td>raydiation</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is a good come-back from the 'This Aint A Game' album, that album was good wit songs like 'wait a minute', 'where do we go from here', 'wet me' and 'formal invite',etc. However, this album is even better. You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ...

A true Magnum fan, In the past I followed them all the way to see them perform live and at there very best, which was in my own personal opinion...All the time ! Vigilante is certainly one of Magnum`s finest example`s of good solid heavy rock on any one given Cd ! \"Need a lot of Love\" is one of there finest along with \"Vigilante\" of coarse ! And there is also track`s like \"Lonely Night\" and \"Midnight\" on there too ! I personally have all Magnum`s Cd`s as I`m so into there genre of music and culture ! I Simply could`nt be without ! But if you like a bit of Live in concert Magnum then i recomend that You get you`re hand`s on Magnum`s \"Live\" cd !</td><td>Stew</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I love historical novels, and that's what I thought this book was, with the added bonus of naughtiness.

It's not a sequel to A Christmas Carol, as some readers assume. It's a great thriller that makes just the right use of its source material, slyly dropping in details that are a delight if you know your Dickens, but in no way detract if you're just reading it as a tightly contructed historical thriller.Remarkable. Definitely a writer to watch.</td><td>Brilliant reinvention</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is the continuation of the story of Tiny Tim but as an adult. The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The \"mystery\" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying.</td><td>Contrived -- SPOILER ALERT</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.</td><td>Too bad it's boring</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wow the whole show was entertaining.

However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books.</td><td>Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with \"Into Thin Air\" or \"The Climb\". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is.</td><td>Don't bother!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>...it's about being \"proud of being the first Danish woman to do so\" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended</td><td>This is not a book about climbing Mt.

They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others?

When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn't aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion.

I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history.</td><td>TEACHERS??</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I just read this for the first time at 28. Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with \"Room 101\" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.</td><td>If you haven't read it, you owe it to yourself</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>George Orwell's prophetic words are coming to pass right before my eyes; You'd see it too, if you got off the TV and started paying attention to politicians and the laws they're passing.I hope there is a revolution of some sort before this grim forecast is played out to the end.</td><td>Scary!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies. Chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this. \"I've repeatedly found,\" he says, \"that when the audience is mostly poor and less educated, I can skip lots of the background ... because it's already obvious and taken for granted by everyone.\" Curious?</td><td>disturbing and relevant</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>What can one say about this book that has not been said before...it is one of the most powerful works one can ever read, which is forever fresh and remains relevant no matter what era it is read in.</td><td>The greatest work of the 20th Century</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn't want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly..</td><td>Orwel Rolls in His Grave</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else.</td><td>A Thoughtful Read</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>With the advancement of Homeland Security here in the United States we are beginning to see the onset of a true big brother. The number of agencies FBI, CIA, INS, and other alphabet soup organizations are now cross matching databases. They are gathering information from local municipalities and those that are in the system, better not have anything to hide.September 11th accelerated the path that we were already on. I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment. I just hope that these \"mistakes, misquotes, and misinformed\" changes never occur in such a draconian fashion.Great book. Everyone should have a copy on their shelves.</td><td>The title should be revised to say 2004!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that \"Brave New World\" book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time.</td><td>George had a good idea but the book really stunk.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton's hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing. As I read I saw everything in my mind as grey and broken but I couldn't put this book down.</td><td>two plus two makes FOUR!!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>At first this book was not a book that I wanted to read, It was assigned to me as an English project I.S.U (Independent Study Unit) so like every kid in high school I started to dread it. As I started to read though, the story started to get better and better. There were points where I just wanted to continue reading and not put it down. The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley. It is quite similar to \"1984\"</td><td>A Very Interesting Read</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us \"We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!\" they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. \"We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears.\" Orwell would've been so proud.</td><td>Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card.</td><td>Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I thought it was a very dull and cheesy book. Every time I picked it up, I fell asleep. I had to read it for school, and it took forever to get here when I ordered it. Barely finished it in time.</td><td>1984</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book for the first time in high school and found it mildly interesting. I read it again recently and realized what an incredible piece of genius it really is. The other thing I realized is that this book makes perfect sense as a satire of Christianity. Big Brother. Thought crimes. Room 101. It fits perfectly. Of course, whether that was Orwell's intent I don't know (though he was an atheist), but I think the book is a masterpiece if analyzed in that way. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope</td><td>masterpiece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>For those of you who wrote that this novel does not make sense as a vision of the future, and could never happen, I would just ask you to look at Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union from a historical perspective. But, then again, there are 2 billion people in China who can not speak there mind without fear of being arrested and the government has control over how many children they can have. Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while.</td><td>1984 as true today as in 1948</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I thought the book was good to read. It gave me an idea of how the world really could be if it wanted to. I enjoyed reading it. I kept me in suspence.</td><td>I thought the book was great.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released.

I had to hold the fan 10 inches from my face before I felt any circulating air, and that was with the fan on High. Due to the size and shape of the fan blades, no air comes out of the center of the fan; what little breeze there is comes out in a small stream on the sides of the fan. I won't comment on the light, since I wasn't interested it that option. Just got it, and I am sending it right back.</td><td>Might as well fan yourself with your hand and save on batteries.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If I could give this a negative rating I would. I guess I was unlucky. Installed batteries, light would NOT shut off. I figured I would just \"break\" the lights since I only needed the fan. Well before I could do that, the fan went out.</td><td>:\\</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The moment I put this cd on and heard the light, lulling strum of a dreamy guitar fluttering like soft breezes that carried with them the whispered caresses of sun-kissed Gregorian chants, followed by the ocean spray of some middle eastern voice sweetly singing amidst gorgeous strings and a hypnotic beat, I knew this was going to be one journey I'd be willing to take for many years to come...and that was the impression I got from the first track alone! Imagine what ensued... It only gets better from there!Every song is aptly titled to create a spellbinding mood, and while I find this exotically soothing debut album by Black Ether (an astonishingly overlooked group) extremely hard to classify because it is so diversified in its use of instruments and styles, I'd have to say if you enjoy lush chillout music with an ethnic-world flavor to it than this is most definitely your cup of tea.</td><td>Like silky, velvet dreams</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed.</td><td>He isn't what I remember.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book could be useful if the examples actually worked. I have barely reached the 50th page and all ready I have found more errors than should be allowed in an entire book. The examples are mis-quoted and several don't work.

It was a waste of money and time. My baby was on pumped milk, so we couldn't just grab some hot water from a drive thru.

This album is good for what it is meant to be, West coast Gangsta music. It's all about lowridin, smokin chronic, kickin' it and gangbangin in the Golden State. Those who are accustomed to Down South music will probably not like some of the west coast funk. It's a different flavor for some. Me being from Cali, I love this stuff. It is rare that someone captures the essence of the west. I do agree with this not being the best album but it's still worth buying. It's got enough head-bangers to get you to the club. That's Cali-4-ya.... 3 1/2 stars</td><td>It is what is......</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Exit to Eden is one of Anne's Best works, in my opinion. Many people were turned off by the film adaptation (why hollywood decided no one would want to see a bondage film is beyond me <eg>) but this book focuses on the relationship of Master and Slave and what happens when the tables are turned. Anne has many sides and Lestat is just one of them. True Rice Fans will adore this beautiful work of fiction.</td><td>Erotic and Romantic... One of Anne's Best!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book was hard to put down. The story was excellent, and the erotic scenes were just as good. Like all of Anne's books, this one was very tastefully done. Well worth it!</td><td>Wonderful story coupled with steamy, erotic scenes.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps in it's time this book was cutting edge, but for those of us within the lifestyle, it's tame and contrived to a very unsatisfying degree. It's ironic that the film adaptation was watered down even more, and turned into one of the worst movies you're likely to see. Ann Rice didn't deserve such treatment.There are books that capture the true essence of the BDSM fanatsy that are much more engrossing, and interestingly enough, Ms Rice has written them as well. (writing as A. N. Roquelaure, see her trilogy in the Sleeping Beauty series)</td><td>Stick with Sleeping Beauty</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Let me start by saying that I never put down a book, even if I don't like it. This is one that I couldn't even get past the first few pages. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but the foul language and vile event depicted in the first few pages turned me off completely to this book. I'm glad it was a free download on Kindle. I gave it two stars only because I didn't give it a chance to get better. If I hadn't deleted it, maybe I would give it another chance, but I certainly won't pay for it.</td><td>Vile from the beginning</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>shame on me for buying it. shame on me for reading it. karen b. wisconsin</td><td>spirirt house. a boring bloody mess.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Reviewer: Renee S. NYC. August 13, 2008The plot is typical Noir, the hero typical world-weary and disillusioned Hammett orChandler, but the atmosphere is stunning!It was a whole new world for me and I fellcompletely into it from Vinnie's first nightmare to the final dripping conclusion.Mr. Moore's descriptions of Thailand andthe Thai people are evocative and real. Onecan feel the heat and humidity, see the swirlsand flashes of colors, and almost touch the waves of misery that radiate offthe pages. And the story's not bad either. I was interested in all the little tidbitsabout life in Bangkok - and the story's not bad either. There were a confusing numberof characters, some of whom did not advance the plot at all, and the plotting could have been tighter, but all-in-all I would definitely recommend the book. Just be sure you read it in an air-conditioned space, because otherwise you will surely melt from its heat!</td><td>Spirit House: Read This In An Air-Conditioned Space</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I thought this was the worst book I ever read. There was no point and way to confusing. he would ramble on about stuff not even importnat to the plot! i hated reading this! stay away from this book!</td><td>I HATE THIS BOOK</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces. The book proves one point to me: burning books and their society is much better than ours where Farenheit 451 can be published</td><td>Re: Is 451 degrees really the temp books burn at?</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader.</td><td>NOT THAT GOOD</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that.</td><td>Start memorizing this book.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb. If you enjoyed \"1984\", \"Brave New World\", or \"The Giver\", you must read this. It is now one of my favorites!</td><td>dystopian classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this was a good book. the part called \"coca\"is the best (about cencorship) the book is kind of like \"the giver\" only a lot better.</td><td>really good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It's the best $.25 you will ever spend.</td><td>What a classic</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book. Firemen who start fires?? Come on. Burning every book that exists, this isn't a look into the future. It's a look into Bradbury's twisted little mind. Bottom Line.... Don't waste your time.</td><td>Didn't Like it!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>What appears on cursory reading to be a story of banned books, with reflection is a comment on the systematic suppression of free thought and free speech. The book gives insight into how those who look the other way or are concerned with rights only as applied to them can actually further the loss of individual freedoms. A very thought provoking novel.</td><td>A book with many levels</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I read this book as a teenager, and I wanted my students to read it as well. Although I loved it, I did not get the same reaction as when they saw the video. However they did think the video was cheesy... :D</td><td>Fahrenheit 451</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's.</td><td>Great Book to read, but NOT to LISTEN to.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This book doesn't deserve one star. It deserves negative 1000 stars. This was the WORST book I have ever read. The book moved to slow, and the characters are stupid. Guy Montag, the main character, is a fireman who sets books on fire, becuase homes are fireproof. Then he meets this crazy girl nmaed Clairese who rambles about dumb stuff of the past that is not important like (Did you know that one time billboards were only 20 feet long, instead of 200) WHO CARES?!?! If there is one book that deserves to be burnt it is this.</td><td>DON'T READ THIS MIND-NUMBING DRIVEL!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is definitely one of the WORST books I have ever come across. In the modern version, there is a forword and an introduction. Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?</td><td>Hardly even deserves 1 star</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Being only a teenager, what I have to say usually means nothing, or gets no credit. I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone. You don't need to love to read, just know how to read.</td><td>Captivating language, needless to say amazing.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.</td><td>Ok</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the \"future\" and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling. A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read.</td><td>Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the \"dumbing of America\" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country).</td><td>Very important book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say \"transcends the genre\" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?</td><td>It'll never go out of date</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Being forced to read it in school for its \"so called\"relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can't say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r.</td><td>Bleak, Blind, and Boring.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering \"wait... what happened?\". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound.</td><td>Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did.</td><td>Sadly a disappointment</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoyed this book very much because it gives you an extreme .look towards censorship and how the media can influence the way we think. An individuals ideas and thoughts are shunned for society in general</td><td>F 451 shows how dangerous a person's ideas are.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too). It is hard to believe that this book was written in the 1950's.</td><td>A must read - especially for teenagers.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this book on tape as read by the author. It is excruciating to listen to. Don't get this! I should have known that an actor would be a better reader than an author!!</td><td>poor reading</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>\"Fahrenheit 451\" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5</td><td>Good</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The book was not so good as the movie, but the book helps understanding some points that seemed totally random when I saw it.Compared to 1984 it's miles away, but still is really nice.</td><td>Explains a lot of things from the movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced. It was very confusing, especially the \"TV family\" which I did not understand at all. It is more of an adult book.</td><td>Fahrenheit 451</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Fahrenheit 451 by Ray BradburyI didnt really like this book, it was all just people rambling on and on about how there life sucks, the whole worlds sucks, and burn books. I dont know how you could enjoy this book. People just talk to talk in this book. Its about a guy named montage that is a firefighter. He burns things instaed of putting fires out.

I have talked to everyone I know and they all read the first 5 pages and immeadiatly hated it. THey rented the movie and watched some of it so they won't have to read it, and it was verbatum, and guess what...it was even worse than the book! I do reccomend this book to all of you...well only if you want to find out how terrible books can get or you want to find out what type of flammable liquid burns better on books!</td><td>BURN THIS BOOK!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book.</td><td>A Very Dark and Mysterious Book</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I am sorry this book did not make any sense and I am a straight A student.

The author has a good idea. We should read instead of watching TV, but if this book is one of the choices you had better turn the TV back on. I mean who in his right mind would ever write a book with 4 wall TVs, robot dogs, and burning books. And the story never really had an ending. It just stopped, I guess to end the boredom. I think the author had to get some sort of deal with all the teachers to assign this book. How else would it get on the required reading list? Maybe he gives 50% of the profits from sales. Please don't buy this book, you are supporting a lunatic.</td><td>Weird Weird Weird Weird!!!!!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I just can say i love this album for the simple reason it is the first one and never equaled in sound, elegance, quality, essence, delicate sadness and youth. It is incomparable and it deserves to be listen by good and pacient tastes in post XX century pop music.I do recomended.(...)</td><td>real cranberries</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is very interesting film that is really five stories in one. A dead girl is found and each story is effected by this in one way or another. A great cast and honest dialogue make this one well worth your time. The film is ultimately sad and depressing, but each story is very interesting. With a cast featuring Toni Collette, Giovanni Ribisi, Piper Laurie and many other talents how can you go wrong?</td><td>INTERESTING AND SAD! , BUT VERY WELL DONE!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>product is great. works like it's supposed to. order processing and shipment speedy and efficient</td><td>motorola phone car charger</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Yep.

This is how much an auto adapter should cost and not the ridiculous price that Motorola and it's resellers charge.</td><td>Well made product at fair price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It works. That's the best I can say about it. The outer insulating cover has started to wear off in many places, exposing wire after only a month.

You can't follow the story line, and if I hadn't read the books I would not understand it at all. The fight scenes take too long and they are also boring. In the mines of Moria there is this one place where you have to go but you get stuck because the game has a bug. The controls are extremely weird and take a long time to get used to. I have bought this game and I do not like it. I would suggest not buying it.</td><td>Horrible Game</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Yes this has good graphics, Yes it has a kind of Zelda theme. But really if your looking for a game that fits the Lord of the rings best then get the Two Towers. Once you are used to that then get the The Return of the King. That is the best game of them all. Ive played all three and the Fellowship is by far the worst game i have ! Please Gameboy dont let Vivendi Universal (the makers of this game) ever make a game based on a film ever again. They wasted away all the good parts of the books and if you want to fight on this game then good luck to you. DO NOT BUY THIS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !!!!</td><td>why oh why does anyone play this</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I have read the book and enjoyed it. It is not one of my favorites, but it fills in some of the story line. I will be rereading the book. I have all of the Floating Outfit series and am in the process of reading them in order instead of how I purchase them.</td><td>The Code of Dusty Fog</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I won't go into the plot as other reviewers have already given you a rather complete synopsis. After the beginning of the book the character development was weak and disappointing. Annie starts out as a strong, quirky individual by mid-book she's so hung up on Jake that she looses her charm and strength of character. Jake was just too angst ridden for me to enjoy. The secondary characters problems just brought the book down further. That, and that their major maritial problem is resolved by sex in the sauna well, once again a female character \"melts\".....pun intended. I guess I had anticipated stronger female and male characters, the ones I get from ... I think Ms Wells shows promise but the next book I'll get from the library.</td><td>Intriguing beginning and then schmaltz</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was laughing so hard when I was reading this that I kept waking him up.

It was easy to open and close and there was no possiblity of having it only partially closed. The controls operated ALL the cameras functions, there was no leakage or fogging. This case absolutely works as advertised.</td><td>High Quality For a Reasonable Price</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Just throw them away after 12 hours? I assume these are plastic.

I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough.</td><td>Not worth the great price</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>You would have NO idea reading the description, and looking at the picture on the front, but most of these movies have a rating of PG-13, and there's even an R!!!They are mostly about sex, sensuality, and the like.Yuck. I bought this because my daughter likes the historical movies like Pride & Prejudice and Emma, etc...These are NOT the same. I threw the set away without even opening it. The ratings are on the back. They should be written on the page.</td><td>Warning. I HIGHLY don't recommend this set!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Considering the price of this card, its hard to be disappointed. I installed it into my freshly built system using a full version of Windows XP. As I write this, I am watching an old episode of Star Trek TNG on a small screen on top of AOL. The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system. This card costs about the same as a prime 3D gaming card. It provides dramatic capabilities. ATI has really done a great job with this card. For the price....it cannot be beat.</td><td>Great card, better than expedcted...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As the other reviews noted, there are problems with installing this card, even though I got it working successfully in the end. Although it isn't my top pick for a graphics card, I have enjoyed being able to hook it up to my VCR and print my digital videos to VHS (yes, this is possible, although it is a bit tricky to setup.)I withhold one star on this card for having lack of customer support and being hard to setup. If the user manual would have been more comprehensive, and if the ATI website would have had more help on the subject of installing this card, the whole nasty ordeal of card setup (that almost all night) might have been spared.</td><td>Great card but difficult to setup</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. \"12th rising\", \"brimstone gate\", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar.

But the story line was trite, even contrived. THe \"culinary\" part of the mystery included recipes that, while tasty, are hardly gourmet -- they mostly consisted of things made with Campbell's soup. Not one that I recall was indigenous to Mexico. At least it was a quick read.</td><td>Trite story line with poor recipes</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Joyce was quite understandably frustrated when his magnum opus, \"Ulysses,\" did not immediately receive the critical attention he felt it warranted upon its publication in 1922.Thus it was that the artist, while composing his next work, \"Finnegan's Wake,\" got into the habit of periodically banging his head against the typewriter keys, a poignant expression, obviously, of the searing torment boiling within him.Happily for us, the result of these repeated cranial collisions can be viewed in the contents of this volume.</td><td>an unusual writing technique</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>\"What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than thebluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia;went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she wasbarely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliationcap onto the esker of his hooth\"If I wrote this and attempted to pass this off as a novel, no one would ever read it.

Finningan's Wake reminds me of the canvas I've seen at countless art shows with a jumble of random splatterings of paint. Any one of us could create the same thing. Why don't we?

By far one of the best hardcore albums I've heard in a while. THis album is full of raw, true emotion - it makes me aware of where I am with myself as well as with others. Hatebreed goes further than just delivering a simple hardcore sound - they truly give it in a way that makes me FEEL the music. It has the ability to take one to the emotional edge and back. I would love to thank the band personally for creating and SHARING thier sound with others...and for inspiring me.</td><td>Sraight-up raw emotions...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack.</td><td>I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Hatebreed album Satifaction is the Death of Desire has to be one of the all time best albums I have ever heard. I list to a lot of hardcore and and this album never comes out of my disc changer. If you are looking for strong lyrics, strong music, and an awsome groove that you and your friends can kill each other to, buy this and never stop listening to it.</td><td>Hatebreed is the god of all that is god about hardcore.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement.</td><td>Worse than \"The Quest\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I had bought one of these for my old dog (a large German Shorthaired Pointer) who had a horrible pulling problem. And it worked perfectly for him, and he didn't seem to mind. On the other hand I just bought one of these for my 10 month old Coonhound, and it also worked to stop his pulling. But he hates it! I can't take him for a walk without him trying to get it off atleast 3-6 times. I think this may just be because he loves to sniff the ground so much that this kind of makes his head go higher up, but now I have to order him something else to stop his pulling because of what difficulty it is to use this for him.

Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the \"alternate-scenario\" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point.

It actually only helps you find the love of your night. If I had actually used any of the tips in the book, I would have had alot of sex but I doubt finding my soulmate would have been possible.

But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again.

And even it \"Charles's Birthday Card\" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, \"Will You Gamelan For Me?\" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on \"What's is a Componium, Part 2,\" a track that sparkles like moondust. \"Calypso in a Box\" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time.

The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.</td><td>Not a horror movie, a horrible movie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Okay, if you're a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you're a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I've ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN'T show you. The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the '63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!</td><td>Absolute Crap!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special \"special effects\" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting. The only thing that's scary about this film is that someone actually tried to improve upon a classic horror movie so frightening the memory of which still scares me after 30 years. The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it.</td><td>A Truley Horrible Horror Film</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare</td><td>Too awful to be funny</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Is \"The House On Haunted Hill\" so different than \"The Haunting\"? Both share the same failure. A great old story that can be pictured every year and still make a good THRILLER. But this movie makes it no better than a poor picture!Good actors, good story but not well told with its poor suspense! The old classic movies with their limited graphics were much more successful!!!</td><td>Catherine Zeta-Jones trap!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you like super-natural mysteries, then you'd like this film. It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.</td><td>Great Mystery - Not So Great Horror Flick</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a \"horror\" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into \"stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive\" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)</td><td>...and what a feeble haunting it is!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sad Sad SadThe waste of talent in this movie is such a sad state of affairs. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a much higher caliber actress, along with Liam Neeson's lame attempts to make this movie palatable is such a crime.... almost as if the movies' set was haunted!The beginning of the movie has so much promise - you feel the backround of the centralized story has promise, you get suckered into the premise this house has to offer - then, and without warning, the silliness begins.It is as if you've been thrown into an Addams Family reunion - the story line starts to wander, the characters continue to wander, and ideas and solutions pop-up without a warning or explanation...To say a \"horror\" movie isn't believable almost sounds absurd, but this movie gets you suckered in, then throws you on the floor flat...This is a definite - do not buy, borrow or rent! Just wait for cable!</td><td>Great - then ZZZZZZ - then EGADS, what a waste!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The actors in the movie are a great bunch, but when the plot is very weak, you dont get very much. I mean Liam Neeson! Hes a great actor, but was very weak in this movie. it wasnt scary at all, the the end of the movie was bad. There was maybe one scary part, which was when a fake lookin skeleton popped up and made me jump. That was all. I dont recommend this movie to people who like scary movies, b/c it was a polar opposite.</td><td>Poor plot</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (\"I've got the save the children!\" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible. Let's just put it this way: I just sacrificed 10 minutes of my time to write this review so that you won't waste 1 hour and 40 minutes of yours on this film.</td><td>Catherine Zeta-Hipboots</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Third grade mentality, third-rate dialog. Not for adults. Egads, I actually bought the DVD. Shame on me.</td><td>Typical Hollywood pulp</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is the worst film of all time. The only amusement came from making fun of the acting. How they got Liam Neeson and Zeta Jones to be in this movie is incredible. I was looking forward to bathroom breaks so I would miss some of this movie. Total poop!!</td><td>EMBARASSINGLY BAD</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>\"The Haunting\" with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set. Why don't they remake \"The Wizard Of Oz?\" Now, there's a picture that could be made MUCH pertier with modern cinematography. The cheap set and old theatre-style acting throw a damper on what's still is a great universal story.</td><td>IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This overdone remake of the brilliant 1963 classic is sorely disappointing. If it had been released as an original movie with an original title, it would have worked. The special effects (though good) were too much for this movie to bare.</td><td>Sadly Disappointing</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This 1999 horror film based on the original \"The Haunting\", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get \"The Blair Witch Project\".</td><td>It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn't spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson's wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older 'Haunting.' You'll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn't necessarily mean better.</td><td>Poor re-make of a good movie</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The seat was a cinch to install.

I was only able to fit a few diapers and wipes and the other small items. I wasn't even able to fit a change of clothes.

Their attempt was to create an \"American music\" from native American sources of rhythm and tonality.

Don't expect much in the way of tom-toms and movie indian harmonies. I love to find songs that go to unexpected places. I found that here.For a much more sophisticated review, search \"American Indianists\" and Fred Flaxman.</td><td>A Surprising Find</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, \"accidental\" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.</td><td>5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.</td><td>Make sure you see Jean de Florette first</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought a SimpleTech CompactFalsh card of 256Mb to use with my digital camera (Minolta DiMAGE 7i) but it does not work !

A lot of sound and fury signifying very little. There are marriages; there are deaths; there are love affairs; there are suicides; there are battles... so a lot does happen. BUT-- I don't care about the characters. If you don't care about the characters, then all their quirky faults seem abstract and dull. Like dusty butterflies in a catalog, their various lives are chronicled. It's a dry description of their adventures and I'm left with a \"so what?\" Maybe his dryness passes for sophistication, but this book left me cold.</td><td>Too Boring to Continue</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions.</td><td>Columbian family values</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.</td><td>500 pages of boredom</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>this book changed me ... it changed the way i look at things ... the way i observe all the events in my life ...it wasnt easy to read at the beginning ... but this book helped me get rid of depression ...writing the characters names with a brief about each of thm will help you alot</td><td>my #1 book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This was my first encounter with the magical realism style and I love it!

This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece.</td><td>One of the best ever.....</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I approached this novel with reluctance. A friend recommended it but said it was best to read it in the original Spanish. I don't understand Spanish, but I decided to try the English translation. I was overwhelmed. For days I was in a trance. I could not and did not want to pull myself away from Macondo and the Buendia family. The words hypnotized me. The scenes evoked haunted me during the day and filled my dreams at night. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has created a masterpiece in any language.</td><td>A Haunting and Incredible Experience</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As I opened this book, I thought to myself \"Wow! This seems like a great story!\" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....</td><td>lesson in the depravity of man</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is what I think my problem is... I didn't like the translation of the book. If the novel was written in Spanish and then translated into English, I would sit there and say to myself that I loved the descriptive, but not the flow of the sentence. I am compelled to give this novel another try based on these reviews. It has been a few years and I feel it is well deserving.</td><td>Could never read this book....</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.\"Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude\" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!</td><td>Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made!

Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story.

I should have just rented it. The only entertaining part of this movie was the bar scenes, all of which were shown in the trailer. That about sums up the good scenes. When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it! Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded. I just wanted to smack her and say just do it and stop your whining and sniveling!

The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!</td><td>Absolutely horrible!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I love this movie,i watched it the first time with my best friend and then realized that i had to have a copy of it because its such a great movie</td><td>Great Movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this cd initialey by mistake. I was in a hurry and missed the cd i wanted right next to it. It must have been God's hand directing me to this stunning album. I had only heard the band on the radio and by the time song one was over i was hooked. I sat there and let Shirley Manson's rich voice enthrall me through the rest of the cd. I went out immeadiately and found their first cd, which was just as good, but in a different way. That is what makes this a great band (among other things). THe ability to reinvent without loosing the soul/sound of the music.Two great albums. I can only hope that they grace us all with many more.</td><td>Stunning</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>this cd is even better than the first and if u are thinking about getting, it my advice is to go buy it. go spend a measly 15 bucks to get it, its well worth the money.</td><td>A must have. Not a bad song on the albumn.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Its amazing how this sounds very odd the first time around you hear it.. then slowly it just hits you and you can't stop listening to it. Also this cd is sorta more insane (literaly) than the first one. and its abit more slow paced. Rocks. Get it! Also, this is the cd that got me nuts about garbage too.</td><td>Rocks. Best. Get it.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Garbage rocks. Shirley Manson has a uniqe voice which is great. The music for this record are very expressive and the tunes are very singable.</td><td>GREAT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought Garbage's first album first and I thought the album was great, boasting good tracks like Milk, Queer, Only Happy When it Rains, but the sophomore album was even better. 'Temptation Waits' started out with Manson's menacing voice with simplistic lyrics like, \"I tell you something, I am a wolf but, I like to wear sheep's clothing.\" The second track had a rockier edge to it, and then slowed down with 'Medication'. And then it was fun all the way till \"You Look So Fine\" which ended the album with a sombre note, like how Garbage ended its first title with \"Milk.\"A great buy, almost perfection - you will just repeat it again and again without losing interest.</td><td>the album grows on me...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Garbage is a band like no other. You really have to take a listen to this amazing band to realize how one incorporates so many styles into one little album.This album is packed FULL of classic Garbage songs that can really give you the chills. The opening track \"Temptation Waits\" was very eerie the first time I heard it and I loved it. The next track \"I Think I'm Paranoid\" has that heavy bass and light vocals that the band is known for, love the lyrics too.A great album for anyone looking to continue digging thru Garbage. A word of advice though...don't bother with beautifulgarbage if you are a rock fan...defienatley not impressive.</td><td>Shirley...yum</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Garbage deliver more terrific euro-trash rock on their second album, 1998's \"Version 2.0\". Another mix of crunching guitars, wild beats, groovy keyboards & effects, and the sensual voice of Shirley Manson, the band are still the frontrunners of modern rock, with such great, rockin' tracks as \"Temptation Waits,\" \"I Think I'm Paranoid,\" \"Push It,\" and my personal fave, \"Sleep Together.\" There's also playful pop-rock with \"Special\" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious \"Hammering In My Head,\" and the truly gorgeous \"You Look So Fine.\" Fabulous music & production from a fabulous band, \"Version 2.0\" is essential Garbage.</td><td>Shirley & The Boys Do It Again</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Been watching this show on DVD since I got it. It made me even make want to get season 8 in the store which I did. It's a great show, one of my fav shows</td><td>Great show</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>AFTER RECIVING THE 7TH SEASON SET AND IT WOULD NOT WORK...I MADE A SHORT PHONE CALL AND HAD A REPLACEMENT THE VERY NEXT DAY...WOW, WHAT SERVICE....MY GRAND-DAUGHTER ALSO THANKS YOU!!!</td><td>GREAT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Disregard stories about how Hellman cooked up this story and then passed it off as true. Or about Redgrave's protest at the Oscars. Both apparently true (certainly the second one is). Just see this movie because it's simply one of the best movies and stories of all time. The script and acting are both top-notch.</td><td>absolutely engrossing and wonderful movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>If you like Jane Fonda or Vannassa Redgrave you'll like this movie.The content is dark but considering it's WWII that won't be a surprise. The movie is touching,sad,and in someways makes you feel nice about love and friendship and in another way makes us wonder how far we'd go in the name of friendship.</td><td>Julia</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...</td><td>Review of JULIA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I bought this game thinking it was going to be cool as hell, But I was sadly mistaken when I got halfway through it and I kept hitting glich after glich. I thought it was my Xbox, but I took it to a friend's and glich after glich. I guess I got the worst game in history, but that's what happens when you get a massed produced game like this one</td><td>Glich Heaven</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>What a great video! I just received it and went through the routine. The flow was wonderful. (I am not a surfer, have never surfed, I was just looking for a good video, and everybody recommended this to me.) But maybe now I'll be surfing by summer!</td><td>Wonderful flow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer, there is no special \"surf yoga\" as opposed to \"regular\" yoga. Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit. Peggy's videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury. It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a \"yoga matrix\" which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.</td><td>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the \"instructor\" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video.</td><td>Another Bogus \"How to be a better surfer DVD.\"</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>If you know anything about yoga, do not buy this cd. The only positive parts is the location and view of the waves. This is more a novelty than useful. Honestly who does yoga in a wetsuit at pipeline..Try Ali McGraw's Video for a great intermediate yoga tape.</td><td>dont do it</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I purchased this book under the impression it had a book key for QUIA, required by my profesora.It didn't have any book key... so now i have to return it. And just buy the one from the bookstore, like I should have done from the beginning.Also UPS was a day late, and didn't leave the book as I requested by signing the \"LEAVE PACKAGE\" form left by the delivery man. I had to go pick it up myself because I'm never at home.</td><td>no book key</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This thing is ok. But realize, you must hold it onto your blow out port to make it work. Therefore you need 2 people to blow out your pipes. When you are blowing out an rv, constant air pressure is the key. So, saying that, i ripped off the needle and attached an air chuck fitting to it. Now I just screw this on, attach my air hose and pop on the compressor and I no longer need to hold it in place.</td><td>Needs some modification</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>When I selected this book I was looking for a book I could share with young children, ages 5 years and up, to give them a glimpse of Nigeria, its people and culture. I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are.</td><td>Nigerians! An Industrious People</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My son was very excited as we put the CD in the player! But when the music started, he was very unhappy!! The songs don't sound anything like the ones on the show. The melody and pace are different- and the performers aren't interesting. DON'T BUY if you are familiar with the 'REAL' songs.</td><td>If you love the songs on Noddy, DON'T BUY!!</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one.</td><td>Nice Experience.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>... to Jazzie of Hampstead, London. Don't know what you were looking at. Your last graf, where you make up some quote from Lou at the end of the show, is totally bogus. In fact, Lou says just the opposite. Pay no attention to that innacurate review. Lou has his good nights and his bad nights. This was one of the best performances of his career.</td><td>A rebuttal ...</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>So far I really like it. It's very informative and useful. I would have given 5 stars but I have it on Kindle and in hindsight would have rather gotten the book in paper. It's difficult to \"flip through the book\" and find what you need. But I am fairly new to Kindle so maybe it's just me. Or old fashion enough to prefer a book in hand. But I do recommend it in whichever form you prefer.</td><td>Native American Herbal Remedies</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none.</td><td>blleeuurrgghhhh</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This movie is about two twins who look alike and they are on there own soccer team.They switch teams without their mom nowing.</td><td>Dad is in Trouble</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I think this movie was great! I just couldn't stand the bad acting of the guy mary-kate's character liked. He seemed to be angry at her even when they were just talking. yuck!</td><td>can't stand those male co-stars</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This movie had bad acting. The dad is dramactic and corney. The mom is just corney, and all of the soccer coaches are acting like it was big pro sports championship. The olson twins were corny but entertaining to watch. This movie is unrealistic that Emma (ashley) and Sam Mary Kate were on 2 different teams. (It's a rule that siblings be on same sports team) This movie has bad quality actors and a unrealistic plot.</td><td>bad acting</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Switching goals was very good. The plot was better than the average Mary Kate and Ashley movie, but it wasn't as funny or had as good of acting as the others. This movie is good to watch a couple of times, but only a couple times. If you have extra cash though, I say get it. You won't regret it.</td><td>Switching Goals - a very good movie</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>My son wanted this video so we got it. There is a danger in making things that children think are REAL. Maybe a few more warnings in the video saying this is NOT real would be good.</td><td>Entertaining, but freaky</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Langston Hughes is definitely a better poet than he is a novelist. I found this book to be lack luster and boring. Although you may like a character or two...in general the characters were not developed nor were they intriguing. His wording lacked the rapture that we are accustomed to him delivering.</td><td>Will bore you to death</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I really liked this book. The characters were intersting and the relationship Sandy had with his grandmother made me think of my grandmother. The book would be good for young people to give them a idea of what black life was like back in the 20's and 30's.</td><td>A good book</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>I contact the company by e mail to return the product as directed the company e mails back to ask for a reason and if the product was opened I replied and the company DID NOT what is the next step to return the product ?????????????</td><td>Not happy</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great suit, great buy, great service all around! I would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a Frosty suit to buy one of these.</td><td>Nice suit.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>As other reviewers have suggested, this book is FULL of errors. I used this book (along with the official guide and the REA book which is much better) for my preperation and found it to be virtually useless. There are so many errors that I found myself unable to trust the book as a source on any information that I didn't already know to be accurate. Which of course defeats the purpose of a study guide. Many of the mistakes are obvious, but perhaps more problematic are the several instances where the author explains a subtle point in error.This book is not worth the time.</td><td>Worst test prep book I have ever used.</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I just began using this book to review for the GRE in April. I haven't gotten very far into the book, but in the first 15 pages I have already found four seriously misleading errors (and that's just the ones I've caught!). Some of the equations (even the Henderson-Hasselbalch) they provide are wrong. There is even a convenient example worked out with an erroneous equation. You can use this book to learn about what topics you should study for the GRE, but do the actual studying from real chemistry textbooks.</td><td>preliminary review</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>This is an awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. The Best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do</td><td>Wild Wild West</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>This is too small for the age of child it's designed for. I swear there used to be a larger version. Plus, it didn't survive more than a few sessions of our play group before the spring broke.</td><td>Isn't there a larger version of this game??</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. Once it was initally set-up he had a blast when the teeth chomped down on his finger (very gentle). However, after 2 rounds of play we were unable to get the teeth to pop back up or to get the rest of the teeth to push down. Needless to say he was very disappointed as was I. Does not appear to be very durable or we just got a bad one.</td><td>Disappointed</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>I specifically bought this toy because it was self contained with no parts to loose. It was to be taken on a trip to visit with my 5 year old grandson. What fun! We laughed and pushed the teeth down while taking turns. Well, after less than a day the only tooth that would cause the jaws to snap was the center tooth. Not too much fun there. I feel I wasted my money.</td><td>It's great when it works</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>yes this video is bad quality but it is great to see bowie and the spiders in their final concert, bad quality or not. I'm only 16 and obviously never had the privilidge of seeing them live so this is a great opportunity. I believe the Ziggy era was the most fascinating and exciting, adrogyny is the only way to go!</td><td>the bad quality doesn't ruin the concert</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine action films were 30 minutes long. There would be no time for sub-plots or romantic involvements or \"No! You go on without me ...\". All there would be is car chases and explosions. Godwill's book is rather like that.I liked it.Forget the measured blend of theory, fact and example which is the style of O'Reilly's authors. This book cuts to the chase, and it works.You see, Tomcat is a servlet runner. It isn't that interesting or even the best of breed (Jetty is way better). Tomcat is as interesting as what you do with it, and Goodwill drags you along through a flash tour of all the goodies.Its a bit like a night tour of Naples on the back of an Italian cigarette smuggler's Vespa. Somehow, at the end, despite not having understood much, you find you know your way around and feel comfortable exloring further on your own.Take it or leave it. That's just the kind of book it is.</td><td>Goodfun</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>A waste of time.Glory for old time movies that try to claim a life in a new world, and they don't.Don't bother, a nice tape to record over.And the last time I buy a film because Brandon Frazier is in it. Naked or not!</td><td>Borinmg & dumb</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>One of the best films ever made, Gods and Monsters works on many levels. It presents the many roles men play -- gay/straight, husband/bachelor, parent/child, lover/monster, youth/elderly, whitecollar/bluecollar -- wrapped in a captivating story. Listen for the music; it's hauntingly beautiful.</td><td>Best film of the year</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>\"Gods and Monsters\" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie.</td><td>See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>One of the few recent films that I anticipated to be good and it exceeded my expectations.Sir Ian McKellen once again performs well. The real surprise here is Brendan Fraser. Thanks to Bill Condon's amazing screenplay, Fraser is study of expressive and innocent contrast to McKellen's anguished and self-defeated character. Make a point to get this one. Best screenplays consist of strong dialogue, pacing, and narrative. The Oscars are usually accurrate about that.</td><td>best screenplays have more stability</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The manufacturer packed this product so poorly that the plastic joints between sections of the tree were smashed, and the pole in the center of the tree was bent beyond redemption. I have no idea how this tree looked all put together since I had to repack it and send it back. Thankfully Amazon.com's return policy is generous and swift - they get five stars for service!

the abbreviated text  there is absolutely nothing  no forward  no reader s guide  no author bio    nothing  So  not the most helpful textbook On the bright side  it is well bound and the type is quite easy to read I am returning the book  and looking for a more suitable edition

picture book for an adult to share with a child  or children  in dealing with the subject of death  However  as a person of faith  I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death The text states   Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever   This statement either reflects the authors  intent on only dealing with

first extensive history I ve read about the airlift effort to save Paulus   th Army trapped at Stalingrad  He offers original research into    the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain  th Army by airlift  and   just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift  For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front  this book is a must read </td><td>List(i, ve, read, a, tremendous, amount, on, the, subject, of, ww, ii, history, so, very, rarely, do, i, read, a, book, with, anything, new, to, tell, me, this, book, is, in,
