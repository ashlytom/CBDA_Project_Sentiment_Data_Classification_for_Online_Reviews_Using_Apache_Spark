recording because they ve mixed her voice through computers so much The worst thing is that she tries to shock us with this album  As if kissing Madonna weren t enough  now she sings about her sex drive  her shopping  bumping and grinding with boys and her  boom boom   She even sings about masturbating  It isn t shocking  because everybody else has done it first  Heard of the Divinyls  They did a better song about  touching myself  Oh  and I notice that a lot of recent positive reviews for this are by the gushing  music fan  who keeps posting anonymous reviews  Sometimes it s just one posted

before you press  Add to Shopping Cart  or hit    Click ordering     C mon Amazon       get your act together       I love shopping here      This is among the tiniest DVD format players available  it states in the last line of the product description  yet its product dimensions state that it weighs   pounds       more than a bag of sugar       I do not think so  would Samsung design something that heavy for kids to lug around   watch a video    Top that off with    pounds for a shipping weight from Amazon s listing and you get retailers charging                      for shipping costs    Does this player come with its own pet brick to comfort it during the trip to its new home    I am amazed that Amazon is forcing us to beware of such tactics while visiting your site       don t you want us to feel comfortable with the information pricing given at each products  site    Do other shoppers out there not look at shipping costs before you press  Add to Shopping Cart  or hit    Click
