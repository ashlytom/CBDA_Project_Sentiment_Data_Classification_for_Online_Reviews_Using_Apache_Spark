crashes and hallucinates about this stupid little kid who calls himself  le Petit Prince  who lives all alone on a planet the size of a table  One day  a talking flower comes along and makes him depressed so he somehow magically goes to see other planets and ends up on earth where he meets a talking fox and Antoine de Saint Exupere  He then regrets leaving his planet and tells a talking snake to kill him so he can   return to his planet   So now  after reading my review you see what a waste of valuable time this book is     This Book is about a nutcase who draws snakes with elephants
