even for the non-gamer","This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^"],[1,"The best soundtrack ever to anything.","I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."],[1,"Amazing!","This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."],[1,"Excellent Soundtrack","I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross"],[1,"Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it","If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."],[1,"an absolute masterpiece","I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"],[0,"Buyer beware","This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"],[1,"Glorious story","I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."],[1,"A FIVE STAR BOOK","I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!"],[1,"Whispers of the Wicked Saints","This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."],[0,"The Worst!","A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."],[1,"Great book","This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."],[1,"Great Read","I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."],[0,"Oh please","I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."],[0,"Awful beyond belief!","I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"],[0,"Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.","It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"],[1,"A romantic zen baseball comedy","When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about \"BY THE SEA\". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"],[1,"Fashionable Compression Stockings!","After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."],[1,"Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High","Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help."],[0,"sizes recomended in the size chart are not real","sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it"],[0,"mens ultrasheer","This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"],[1,"Delicious cookie mix","I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."],[0,"Another Abysmal Digital Copy","Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere \"out there\" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."],[1,"A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens","I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"],[1,"i liked this album more then i thought i would","I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like \"blue angel\",\"lanna\" and 'mama\" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."],[0,"Problem with charging smaller AAAs","I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."],[0,"Works, but not as advertised","I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a \"backup\" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."],[0,"Disappointed","I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries."],[0,"Oh dear","I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but \"more than equal.\" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid.

Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."],[0,"Incorrect disc!","I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy.

All I get is a \"incorrect disc\" message."],[1,"happy with it...but","I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it.

You bet it is","Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC."],[0,"Nothing you don't already know","If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"],[0,"Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.","When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD.

The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones.

The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund.

Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil.

I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price."],[0,"Disappointed Romanian!","This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is \"clean and proper\" and fails to shed light on the rest of it.

It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now.

This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."],[1,"Thank you for Releasing it!!!!!","I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!"],[0,"Very Not Worth Your Time","The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages."],[1,"Very fun and educational","Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."],[0,"Ludicrous and silly","I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."],[1,"Artistry","I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."],[0,"Caution!","These tracks are not the \"original\" versions but are re-recorded versions.

With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."],[1,"YES!!!","When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series."],[0,"Not the best in the series","Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."],[0,"ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance","I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."],[0,"Too Uncomfortable and Too Big","These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."],[1,"Very authentic","This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."],[0,"Not the best","I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."],[0,"Doesn't Fit","I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat.

She can dress the Kelly kids, \"train\" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse."],[1,"Loads of fun!","My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!"],[0,"easy and fun for 3-4yr olds","fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue.

The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what?

The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."],[0,"Don't Be Fooled!","I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!"],[0,"Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!","This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs.

There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end).

Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life.

We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan.

They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places."],[1,"Worth the investment","This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the \"fun\" factor. For younger babies that may not \"get it\" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months.

And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."],[1,"Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!)","I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick.

It was not on a tree root!!!"],[0,"MASK OF FAMILIARITY","MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."],[0,"Unmasked..................","Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."],[1,"A museum exhibit inside a book","This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."],[1,"Great resource for Chinese/Eastern medincine","This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing.

Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh."],[0,"Will not be purchasing another one of these","It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."],[0,"False Advertisement","The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues.

He got me on the \"Controlgel\" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the \"Controlgel\" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the \"Smoothing Serum.\" What a WASTE!!"],[1,"LOVE IT!","I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it!

Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"],[1,"The Best !!!!","Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough."],[1,"Great control racquet","A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."],[0,"DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!","My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."],[0,"Bad skating technique","I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."],[0,"A complete waste","My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile."],[0,"4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks","I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."],[0,"Barbie's Boring Ice Show","I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."],[0,"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS","This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud."],[1,"IT'S GREAT!","All the other reviews say this product is boring and \"save your money\"....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater \"never falls\"?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"],[1,"A good game to buy.","I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the \"frustration factor\", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a \"5\" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the \"easy\" and \"medium\" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."],[1,"Great Game","My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went."],[0,"Not really what I wanted","For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called \"Perfect Gentleman\" with 2 titles on it: \"Ooh la la\" and \"One more Chance\". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy."],[1,"Rare find","A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read."],[0,"Fire Truck Puzzle","The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated.

But I am very pleased with the quality."],[1,"Dark Horses a must have CD","I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."],[0,"Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous","What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity?

My favorite line in the book is \"This is a paranormal disaster area!\""],[1,"The Best Yet!!!","Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!!

It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"],[1,"Possibly the Best out of this series!","It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"],[1,"Amazing!","LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!"],[1,"One of the best books I've ever read!","DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J.

If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."],[1,"2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer","I just loved Daughters of Darkness!!

How would he how where they were going?"],[1,"I'm hooked and I want some more ...","I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called \"Daughters of Darkness\" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"],[1,"L.J. Smith has so many correct details....","I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"],[1,"It was great!!!","I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night."],[0,"Disappointing","I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."],[1,"mirroring the reader","I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."],[0,"Don't Waste Yout Time","Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it."],[0,"Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information","To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."],[1,"Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....","Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."],[1,"A rare & wondeful treat","I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video.

Works well too."],[1,"Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!","Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again"],[0,"Very annoying!","This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus \"feature\" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed."],[0,"Extremely Disappointed with this video","I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the \"Sing A Long\". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."],[0,"Just so-so","This is a DVD with footage of a \"Come Out and Meet Thomas\" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the \"party/interview\" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either."],[0,"More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much","I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."],[0,"A long promo for the Thomas center(s)","Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."],[0,"Poor DVD","Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD."],[0,"My Son finds it annoying","My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."],[0,"Feels like a commercial...","All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"],[1,"Makes you not want to sleep at night.....","This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!"],[0,"$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site","This product description is WRONG.

I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything."],[0,"Too bad....","Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."],[1,"Dockers do the job.","This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."],[0,"False advertising","If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants."],[0,"Don't Trust the Images","Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. \"Cafe,\" for example, should be \"Coffee.\" Despite the fact that the image for \"Cafe\" shows a stone or very light gray color, \"Cafe\" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."],[0,"So disappointed","I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are \"deals\" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."],[1,"Fantastic Book","This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."],[0,"Disturbing","Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."],[1,"A Taste of Italy","Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying."],[1,"Perfect book for a long flight....",".... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above."],[1,"Delicious reading","I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a \"trifle overdone\" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons."],[1,"Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy","THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."],[1,"I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...","This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!"],[1,"One of the best!","If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it."],[1,"Cameriere!","I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard \"chick lit\" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to \"Roman young stud\" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than \"Cooking for Mr. Latte\" - it was a fun read."],[1,"Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way","I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!"],[1,"\"Chick Lit \" for \"Foodies\"","What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film."],[0,"Not very good....","I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"],[0,"Do not waste your time....lousy","This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is \"the best ever experienced\" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."],[0,"The food is sexier than the sex","This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."],[0,"Back to basics","Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA.

But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words \"huh,\" \"what,\" and \"yeah\" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what \"so-called\" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it."],[0,"this album is garbage,straight bfi material","cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time."],[1,"I feel ya \"Ghenry187@aol\"...this CD rocks.

I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details."],[1,"Good place to start Web development","It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts."],[1,"Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.","I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy."],[1,"Thoughtful, contemporary fiction","Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."],[1,"Why Some People Complain","The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system."],[0,"My Daughter Hates It","I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."],[1,"glider","the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"],[0,"bench","The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy."],[1,"Great Glider","We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"],[0,"Gauges in chair arms","Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them."],[1,"Very nice glider","Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice."],[1,"Fantastic glider/ bench","Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio."],[1,"James Moody takes San Diego \"Beyond the Border\"!","James Moody, and his well known \"cast of characters\" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've \"never heard it played like THAT before\"."],[0,"Seal IV","I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day."],[1,"Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories","I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."],[0,"Too Much on the Mystical Plate","The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."],[1,"God's Zoo","Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs."],[1,"Different","The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think."],[1,"Awesome","This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism."],[1,"An interesting little essay","Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile."],[1,"Great Actors - Well done film!","Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the \"in-laws\" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live \"Happily Ever After\". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."],[1,"Great movie, not so great DVD","This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of \"boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married\" this movies looks at the question of \"then what?\" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better."],[0,"an extreme emotional ride","If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."],[0,"Grrrrr. Arrrrgh.","We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling."],[1,"I give it 5 stars because it's entombed","I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, \"uprising\". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!"],[0,"bye bye mom and dad","My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."],[1,"Bass - voice delight in jazz music","Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude."],[1,"Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal","This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service."],[1,"Fabulous...","This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not.

Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions!

Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the \"pounce on each other in the first chapter\" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts."],[1,"Riveting","I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special \"gifts\" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has \"gifts\" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the \"I hate you!\" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."],[0,"Not her best...........","Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards."],[0,"This one is missing that Feehan Spark","This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a \"mystery\" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read."],[1,"Intriguing story","While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library."],[1,"amazing","I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!"],[0,"Too Boring","This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more \"Dark Series\" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-("],[0,"Ick ack. Put it back.","I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, \"leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to\". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier."],[0,"disappointed","i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again."],[0,"Not up to scratch!","I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this."],[1,"WONDERFUL GOTHIC","I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance.

Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore).

Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now."],[0,"Couldn't finish it","I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace.

Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money."],[1,"Very Good","Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection."],[1,"Great for the money","The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."],[0,"Low resolution and poor quality","I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now.

The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the \"who\" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, \"great book, bad ending...\" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"],[1,"Review","This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."],[1,"Love Scarpetta","You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor."],[0,"A really bad book","Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no \"grab\" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, \"I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.\"Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel"],[0,"formula type writing","My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta.

If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."],[1,"Cruel and Unusual","A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy."],[0,"I guess it was a mystery","In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic.

No offence Patricia."],[0,"Inproper Advertising","I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell.

Great read!!!"],[1,"Cruel and Unusual","The book was excellent. I was barely able to put it down. I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more."],[0,"Muddled ending disapoints","The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."],[1,"Spellbound!","This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."],[1,"Very nice book","I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel."],[0,"Too scattered, too shallow","Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."],[0,"Soooooooooooo NOT Funny","This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."],[0,"Totally Unfunny","When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say \"What on earth is this?...\" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing."],[0,"Nasty People! Nasty Film!","Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film."],[0,"zero star","those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!"],[0,"Dramedy","This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing."],[0,"The Not so Funny People","I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 movie/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. I should have walked out like so many others did.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!"],[0,"What happend Sandler?","His movies seem to be going down hill. The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it. Other then that, it is just not that funny. Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free."],[1,"serious comedy","FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets."],[0,"Long, somewhat dull and unfocused","This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about \"comedy\" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."],[0,"WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?","Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying \"tweet\" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."],[1,"Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look","Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press."],[0,"Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.","Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."],[0,"Not so Funny people!","Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved \"Knocked Up\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for \"Bruno\" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it."],[0,"Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best","An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really \"funny people\" involved movies, like \"ANGER MANAGEMENT\" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious \"LITTLE NICKY\"."],[0,"Not what I expected...","I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie.

My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film.

That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."],[0,"profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!","i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."],[0,"Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!!","A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow.

A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans."],[1,"The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!","This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma"],[1,"A wonderful, funny-sad book","The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly."],[1,"good artwork too!","The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."],[1,"Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes","\"The Rabbi's Cat,\" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place."],[0,"Self-Serving Message","This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."],[0,"Not what it looks like on the cover.","As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."],[1,"The Last dissenting Witness","The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms.

Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star."],[0,"The pits . . . a contrived pot-boiler.

Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original.

I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's."],[0,"What a disappointment!","I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed."],[0,"Just awful","This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish."],[0,"A wildly implausible thriller","This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the \"intrigue\" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out."],[1,"From Potter's field, buried with no name","Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell."],[0,"Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability","This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story."],[0,"No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell","At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G."],[0,"a let down","This books just didn't do it for me. I enjoy PC but this book. Seemed too easy. Things just happend, people just called. In fact, I think this books had some bad editing. I felt as though all what was needed was there, and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reason.I am still a fan, but this one is a skipper.The doc just happens, to see the resturante that the killer was using.The polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police. Just does not at add."],[0,"To contrived and therefore not plausible","I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it."],[0,"Stilted and Hokey","This book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled! Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it. I read 1/3 of the book and threw it in the \"yard sale\" pile. It's the first book of hers I've read and I don't intend to pick up a second one. This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for non-readers and quick profits."],[1,"Terror in Central Park","Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page. A woman's body is found in the snow in Central Park. There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult. Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending. It is one of her best. By Ruth Thompson author of \"The Bluegrass Dream\""],[1,"Patricia Cornwell rocks! Best mystery writer on record!","Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery. I've never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel."],[1,"Rekindling Love","Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands."],[0,"Worst English dub of a great TV series","This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy.

Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well."],[0,"Don't bother!","What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!"],[1,"Lincoln and his time","For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America."],[1,"Explains why economics and politics don't mix!","Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace."],[1,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer","Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the \"common good.\" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."],[0,"Don't waste your money.","If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor \"mandatory reading\" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better."],[0,"More of a personal opinion than that of economics","When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book."],[0,"Not what it claims to Be","I was actually looking for a book on economics... This book is more of a conservative rant. It's not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics.

Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well.

Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none."],[0,"Polemic and Outdated","I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have \"the answer,\" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."],[0,"Too simplistic","Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."],[0,"This ain't no economics book!","I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."],[0,"No lessons learned","This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."],[1,"Best book on Economics for the general reader","This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book."],[1,"If you don't have this, get it!","This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy."],[1,"Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication","I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."],[1,"Give this book to a your children.","Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it."],[1,"ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON","Economics in One Lesson is another great \"must read\" book. Like Bastiat's \"The Law,\" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful."],[1,"Never more needed than today","Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and \"higher education\" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."],[1,"Economics even you will Understand","For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"],[1,"Simply brilliant!","This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's \"Crashproof\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression."],[1,"One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!","As a student and teacher of economics, this book has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy (or any other arm of policy making, for that matter). Whether you agree with Hazlitt's conclusions about how the market works or not, you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book. It is entertaining to read, particularly easy for a book about economics. I highly recommend it!"],[1,"Textbook","Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read."],[1,"Our Senators and Reps should read and heed","This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it."],[1,"Great Book","Very easy to read, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book."],[0,"Painful","I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library."],[0,"Unsatisfactory and very outdated","I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."],[0,"Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book","The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book."],[0,"Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading","This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt."],[0,"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses","If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."],[0,"Right-libertarian views presented as fact","The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to \"explode liberal myths\" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the \"successes\" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy."],[0,"ASTOUNDING","It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book. It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date."],[0,"how to fail economics 101","This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad."],[0,"Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid","Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as \"common sense.\""],[1,"Back to basics...","Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant."],[1,"A great alternative perspective","Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy."],[1,"Sanity in Economics","This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off."],[1,"Fine Summary","This is a great primer that should be read in all schools. Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime."],[1,"A good libertarian primer","This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas."],[1,"Important","Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt."],[1,"Economics","Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times."],[1,"Frighteningly Prophetic","An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's."],[1,"Great book","This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost)."],[1,"Great summary of some very difficult economic principles","This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an \"Adam Smith\" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title."],[0,"over-simplified diatribe","Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."],[0,"More politics, less economincs","I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house."],[0,"This book's title is misleading.","This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."],[0,"Seriously Flawed","Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow."],[0,"Not a primer, way too political","Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Hazlitt has an opinion, and he presents it here. I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues, but more importantly, spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals.This book fails in that respect. Keep looking. (Samuelson, Mankiw, Malkiel...)"],[0,"Straight to the trash can!","Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression.

Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here. Good catchy cd, interesting use of instruments and keyboards. Did I mention she is cute little thing. Check out their videos they are a trip."],[1,"Allison rocks!","I have just recently discovered Goldfrapp and boy look at what I have been missing out on!This disc is incredible! My only gripe...it needs to be longer!Number 1 is an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such a shame that US radio does not play such a wonderous mix of techno & electronica on the airwaves, yet forces us to listen constantly to tired rap lyrics about hos and bling, dumb TV show contest winners and R&B; idiocy.Allison has them all beat, hands down!"],[1,"Kids love it","It's Thomas!

Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!"],[0,"Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated movie!","I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song..."],[1,"TMNT Soundtrack","I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff."],[1,"Egbert is such a wonderful name","After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this book. This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station."],[1,"sweet musings for loss and love","Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended."],[1,"The Art of Chinese Medical Science","I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. I would call it an Art of Chinese Medical science."],[1,"What more do I need?","Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder.

More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city.

But when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, can they survive?"],[0,"not quite what I was expecting","I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."],[1,"Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry","In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to \"feel\" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up."],[0,"Nineteen folktales of South and Central America","This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."],[0,"This book is incomprehensible","This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!"],[0,"It wasn't very good!","This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."],[0,"Very boring","I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book."],[0,"on order","I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait."],[1,"Long torso but great product","Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1\". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised."],[1,"Love This Item","I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer."],[1,"Had some problems at first but now i love it","I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."],[1,"Good choice for getting a vintage look","I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."],[1,"Squeem works well","I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires."],[0,"Too small - NO RETURNS","I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again"],[1,"wow","this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier!! Don't give up it is worth it!"],[1,"Great!","I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!"],[0,"Wasn't what I expected","I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."],[1,"great","provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove."],[1,"a good smoother","I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you."],[1,"Works Well!","I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I \"tried out\" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me \"back fat\" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two \"size options\" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your \"natural\" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my \"under/side boob\" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"],[1,"squeem cincher","Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."],[0,"not really worth it","I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better."],[1,"Great product; great seller!","I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller."],[0,"Painful Experience","I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."],[1,"Great Product!","Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down. I've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money."],[0,"poor fit","After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."],[0,"Not recommended!","When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!"],[0,"Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around","The product did what it was \"supposed to\" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."],[0,"Advertized as \"New\" but arrives worn out","Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as \"New\" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as \"New\""],[1,"Great results, with some side effects...","I have one of those \"spare tire\" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to \"make\" me look trimmer..."],[1,"Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles","Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)"],[0,"Upset","I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."],[0,"Falling apart","When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to \"right-sized\" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost."],[1,"ahi","I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it."],[0,"Incrediby difficult to put on","With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks."],[0,"Squeem","I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"],[1,"A bit uncomfortable...","I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive."],[1,"This is the one","I'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. I love that you can't see it under clothes. I notice my back feel better with it on, my posture improves, and I look good in my clothes. I love this!"],[1,"really love it.","Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it."],[1,"Wow!","All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!"],[0,"Not the shape I was going for....","I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my \"excess\" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me."],[0,"Bones","This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones."],[1,"Magic","After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"],[0,"Wrong item shipped!!!!!","I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress. Unfortunately, they shipped the WRONG thing, and now I am stuck with a big, bulky and hideous vest! It has very ugly racerback straps, and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress. And the worst part, I'm out the money! I can't even return it for a refund, even though I haven't opened the box. VERY disappointed in this company. Buyer beware!"],[0,"Sizing is Ridiculous","I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips."],[0,"So what is the sizing?","I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?"],[0,"Causes sweat that makes it unwearable!","This corset makes me Sweat like a hog, I am not I'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape, was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it, because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable, hot and sweaty underneath. This was bad for my skin too, it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods. It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I'd want to take it off immediately, so I never wore it, and just gave up and returned it. Still looking for a perfect corset, this however is NOT it. Don't waste your time."],[1,"best money I ever spent on shape wear","I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed \"WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist\"...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"],[1,"works great","Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times."],[0,"Great at first...not so good over time","Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening."],[1,"Recommend this","I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape. I had a slimmer waist within weeks. You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on. It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to, but I would wear it only while working out. Otherwise, I would take it off.19 years later, after having my second child, I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it. I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts. It is well made and sturdy. The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising. I recommend this product."],[0,"boning is not a plus","It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. It also folds in with the fold of my stomach, which I didn't want, so it doesn't get that pooch area as well as I would've liked. I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good, thats about it."],[0,"Pass","The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."],[1,"Love this!","I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought."],[0,"Poor quality","I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!"],[1,"Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression","I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the \"Extra firm compression\". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!"],[0,"Not the best shaper","This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews."],[0,"It works, BUT....","My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!"],[1,"squeem","I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores"],[0,"Product defective after 1 day of use","The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product."],[1,"a great buy!","after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!"],[0,"No,No,No This is not for me.....","I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)"],[1,"Can't Go Wrong With This Item!","I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product."],[0,"Would be great but...","The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("],[0,"works but uncomfortable","Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it"],[0,"Major let down!","I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."],[1,"Awsome!!","Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it"],[0,"Wasnt worth","I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :("],[1,"GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!!","I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!"],[0,"Not so much","Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service."],[0,"Burn Rubber on Me","I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."],[0,"Not worth the price...","I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."],[0,"Torture","Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP"],[0,"Squeem","The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply."],[1,"I'm very impressed so far","So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach \"pooch\". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"],[1,"Not for everyone","I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a \"flat\" stomach just flabby and then I have \"love handles\" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would."],[1,"Squeem:> A Combination of Scream and Squeeze?","I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. The first couple of wearings were difficult, but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me, I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter, as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping, but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep, rather than in the daytime, but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made."],[1,"excelent product!","This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it."],[0,"Hard to put on","The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!"],[0,"Why does everybody rave when....","This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"],[0,"Uncomfortable!","It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."],[0,"Great idea, poor design","This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems..."],[1,"best shapewear","it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit"],[0,"Waste of time for me","I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me."],[0,"Not OK!!!","When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."],[0,"Not worth the pain it causes","Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. However, I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound. Not worth the pain."],[1,"I love It!","it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. my grandmother even notice it, and she didn't even know i bought it. It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body. I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium."],[0,"disappointed","I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real \"waist trainer\", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for \"waist trainer\", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a \"cincher\" or a \"trainer\"."],[0,"itchy","I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."],[1,"i love it..","i realy love my shape wear, i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she's notice a big difference,"],[1,"Wow, Ow and What's that smell?","I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9\" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes..."],[1,"squeem is pretty good","i have a 28-29 inch waist normally. should've started with a size Small. the XS seemed a bit smaller than described. definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist!"],[1,"Snug Fit","Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!"],[0,"Poor quality and lousy customer service","The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."],[0,"IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!","Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem \"Magical\" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star. More worthy of steaming diarrhea."],[1,"Very sturdy","This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front."],[0,"Worked for 5 days then broke","I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. it really flattens the tummy area, which is all I really want, but you can see the hooks threw clothes :( I felt like that ruined it for me, also I had to keep pulling it up. It bunches in the back, and really smells like rubber. After about 5 or 6 days one of the \"bones\" on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side! it really hurt. I would not recommend this product."],[1,"does its job","recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color. could be little cheaper"],[1,"Squeem","Love this product.

I highly recommend!!"],[1,"Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure","I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."],[1,"simple quick fix","I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx."],[1,"A must have...","This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses. It also offers great support for your back. It is perfect for everyday wear."],[1,"The squeem waist cincher","The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them"],[0,"Wasn't that impressed........","It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets."],[1,"Squeeeeeze into your clothes","I really liked the Squeem. I'm a petite person, but have some love handles that I need to hide when I'm wearing tight clothes. The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it's tight."],[1,"Love it","This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27\" waist before pregnancy, 30\" waist when I bought a size medium, 28\" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted..."],[1,"Good product","I read the reviews for this product and purchased. I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake. I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably. For me if I don't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don't feel it's working. The thing I like the most about it is that's it's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top. Body hugging tops excluded, of course. I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town."],[0,"Waste of money","The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn't work as described on the advert.

I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body.

I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain.

Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it.

If you just want to get comfortable and enjoy a book-this is the one I would suggest."],[1,"The ending was great!","The most unusual story of a young man facing life with a handicap. I felt like a cheerleader and prayed that he could overcome. I could hardly wait to reach the end of the book.

Caan we get the rest of the CTI Catalog back out there???Please?"],[0,"WARNING: This is the worst book ever written","As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."],[0,"Edge of Danger","Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.It¡s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.It¡s obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins...."],[0,"Edge of Danger","1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything."],[0,"Actually, this book is not worth one star.","This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."],[0,"Not Worth The Reader's Time","It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward."],[0,"Disappointing and too simplistic","This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax."],[0,"Worst Book I've Ever Read","This is simply the worst book I remember reading. I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels, so I happily picked this up. I'm sorry I did. It is nothing but action, which might be OK for a fun read on the beach, but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous. Massive action scenes (such as large battles) take place in only 1 or 2 pages. There's no character development, poor dialogue, no setting descriptions, no drama or suspense -- nothing but a poorly-described series of \"events\"! Enough said."],[0,"Formula Writing","I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, \"Edge of Danger\", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector."],[0,"Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins","I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either."],[0,"Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade","Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."],[0,"Writing on autopilot","After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler."],[0,"Sophomoric at Best","Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. \"Damn, he said to Kate, \"It's the Hazar Scouts, \" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"],[0,"A Waste of Time","This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it."],[1,"Plenty of action","This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth."],[0,"Good story- Poor writing","Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."],[0,"Do I have to give it 1-star?","I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?"],[0,"Disappointment on every page","I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."],[0,"I would rather watch paint dry","Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker."],[0,"Tired formula","Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't."],[0,"This is not the Jack Higgins I know","This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."],[0,"Completely predictable","Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss."],[0,"EXTREMELY SHALLOW","This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??"],[0,"Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain","I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"],[0,"Can't believe I read the whole thing","Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."],[0,"I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...","Very few books contain their own review. This one does:\"Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'\"'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'\"This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."],[0,"A bad book, poorly written.","The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."],[0,"higgins disappoints","This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment"],[0,"Poorly Written","The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again."],[0,"A Disappointment","It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. The writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. Save your money for something better."],[0,"Horrible","This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The \"adventures\" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the \"reliablity\" of the author."],[0,"Not worth the effort","Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."],[0,"Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book","A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to \"speak Irish\" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."],[0,"Disappointing and thin","I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out. Also there didn't seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded, and on the surface stupid, behaviour."],[0,"Two Hacks","I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"],[0,"Just skip it","When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book."],[0,"Worst \"Live\" recording I've ever bought!","I bought this CD for one song only, \"Steal Away\". I knew it was going to be \"live\", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a \"muzik, lounge\" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was \"Hot Rod Hearts\", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most \"live\" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of \"Steal Away\"!"],[1,"A Different Collection of Early Stuff","This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to \"Love is Like a Cigarette\" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings."],[1,"Great reference","The book was good. Kept my interest. In no way am I finished reading it. It isn't a book to read from front to back.

Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars. If you have a car 2008 and later it doesn't show.

It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said."],[0,"A thorn in the side of literature.","Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment."],[1,"A Moral Novel with a Mystery","I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."],[1,"Excellent Book","I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone."],[0,"technical problems with cassettes","This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."],[0,"Mundane, Tedious, Just Plain Boring","With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous \"A\" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's \"masterpiece.\" Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's \"A\" interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book."],[0,"Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.","This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS."],[0,"Absolute Waste of Time","My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED."],[0,"A Tedious Read","I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment."],[0,"Classic? Really?","I will never understand how \"Classics\" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."],[0,"This book was OK............","The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline."],[0,"I've read better.","I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking.

I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature."],[1,"Awakening.","This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."],[0,"The Scarlett Letter","Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book."],[1,"Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected","I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."],[1,"Gripping","This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy."],[1,"Good read, but hard to navigate ebook","I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!"],[1,"Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th","A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."],[1,"love it","Book is a great read. Intriguing from start to finish. Cant find anything wrong to say.

A tale of a strong woman that doesn't let society bring her down."],[0,"Typos","The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do."],[1,"Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou","It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden."],[0,"Boring","I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey."],[0,"Hi","D d this y c.f. thy f2f Hertzberg toughening bc. Tiny c..t.v.

I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great."],[0,"Review From One Book At A Time","I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."],[1,"Amazingly Good","I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."],[1,"interesting book","though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture.."],[0,"Not my idea of a good read","I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture."],[0,"Good book to read if you were bored to death!","I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand."],[1,"A well written book!!","The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there."],[0,"The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.","I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"],[0,"Bad Book","This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across."],[0,"Duller than dirt","I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."],[0,"I must say","that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend."],[0,"too hard to follow","the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character."],[0,"Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.","I read this \"Classic\" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."],[1,"Wonderful classic","I enjoy this book very much. It is a timely classic with which I am happy to now have my own copy."],[1,"Worth the effort","I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes."],[1,"Puritanical ostracism","\"Easy A\" explains it best. If you can't relate in some way you must be a robot. Greatest book ever."],[0,"Wasted Time","There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."],[1,"Tragic","Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans."],[1,"Great","Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it."],[1,"It's nice","it's nice. Very nice. Good indeed. I like it. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Exciting. Yes. Do you agree? Hester. Dimmesdale. Pearl. Chillingworth."],[1,"Classic tale","Loved this book as well. The movies as always stray from the book- I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters."],[1,"A Classic Worth Reading","My son had to read this for school and ended up really liking the story. It opened up dialog with us (his parents) about social situations, opinions and morality.I asked him about this review and he chose the review title and star rating."],[0,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!","Please, I beg of you, if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter."],[1,"My favorite classic","Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. It's a classic, must-own for anybody that values the concept of reading. And if you didn't like it the first time, read it again and give it a second chance. I've read it about six times and it gets better each time. Cherish this book."],[1,"Scarlet Letter review","Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times."],[1,"Excellent romance in an excellent edition","Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition."],[1,"The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature","I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers."],[0,"Terrible book, do not read it.","Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."],[0,"Meaningless Drivel","I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary. I have understood two chapters! I don't see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences! It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering. As I stated before, this is not my kind of book!"],[0,"Worst. Book. Ever.","It is my invariably correct opinion that the so-called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed, with EXTREME prejudice, for crimes against humanity and the English language."],[0,"Who Chooses Classics?","I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being \"one of the best novels ever.\" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, \"Ok, so what's the point?\" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time."],[0,"\"Hallelujah!\" is what I said when I finished this book","This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a \"CLASSIC\"?"],[1,"a must read","Everyone needs to read this classic. An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers. I really appreciated it a lot."],[1,"Teachers: This is not his best novel","Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of \"The House of the Seven Gables.\" Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed \"The Scarlet Letter,\" complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)"],[1,"Very good and very unlike the movie","I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie \"The Scarlet Letter\" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different."],[0,"not kindle ready","It's hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. It is not kindle ready, although it is textually complete. Should be a freebie."],[1,"good","this book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so, all's well I guess, and the condition of the book was quite acceptable."],[0,"Boring, very","This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book."],[0,"Boring","My english teacher assigned this book, one I would never read on my own. I am a 16 year old and I enjoy reading. But this book, while it does have a few good points and messages, is incredibly dull. The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class. While this book has a rather good story it`s concealed by endless symbols and references, I suggest the cliff notes version!!"],[0,"Really Hard to Follow","This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow. Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn't understand them until they were pointed out to me. If you don't get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don't read it. There is a lot of symbolism in this book, too."],[1,"A fascinating look into another time's mores","Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards."],[0,"One word: outdated","This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call \"Old English\" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to \"New English.\" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."],[0,"I was fored to read it too","The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times."],[0,"a tragedy","This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a \"classic\" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!"],[0,"too had to read","I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here"],[0,"Simply the worse book ever.","I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars."],[0,"No Active Table of Contents","My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book."],[0,"Should not be a requirement in high school","To me this book would turn a young person, like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading . Being a book with extensive mistakes in it, it is very difficult to read unless you are to inerpret it every paragraph or should I say sentence. I't maybe a classic, but I feel that the word \"classic\" comes from just being old........................................................................................................p.s the only reason I put a star was because I had to, to express my opinion on he novel."],[0,"It was like a bad dream, but I couldn't wake up","This book is like a bad soap. No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star."],[0,"Landscape book","I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me."],[1,"THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO","THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO."],[1,"Excellent gift","My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. She has enjoyed reading it through out X-mas vacation. I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift."],[1,"Great classic for the price","For a first time reading of this classic I recommend this. If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf. This is a nice quality book though. The printing isn't too small, and neither is the book. It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like it.And as for the story, I could go on many pages. Just do a few searches for reviews, it's a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture, past and future.One of the best Classics, great one to get started on or to read over and over again."],[0,"Missing Custom House","My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We \"looked inside this book\" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."],[1,"Incredibly engrossing","I absolutely loved this book, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions, it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive. A flawless book."],[0,"Characterization in The Scarlet Letter","The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story."],[1,"the illiteracy of our generation","Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic."],[1,"The Scarlet Letter e-Book","Great book, had seen the movie but the book is much more. It will hold your attention and is an easy read too.Even better, the e-book was free on Amazon!"],[0,"I just don't get it.","I am an avid reader. I have read many so called \"classics\". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say \"I have not read the Scarlet Letter.\" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried."],[1,"favorite classic","loved it in high school, love it as an adult...Great book and very informative.Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer.Characters and other plot."],[0,"Childish Novel","It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times."],[0,"Jeff the Scorned","I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring. Unless you're interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism, avoid this book."],[0,"Ugh.","I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word \"ugh\" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through \"dost thou\" after \"dost thou\" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book \"The Classics Reclassified\"."],[0,"This book was dumb","I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it, but I just did not like it. Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good, it doesn't help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend."],[0,"Avg. Rating too high","I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace."],[0,"Received a different book","I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received."],[0,"Oh my...","This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, \"Baby daddies,\" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."],[0,"Far too little crime and fist fights","So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con. He did not know much about it, but heard some people talking about it in the food court. I thought it sounded awesome, like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader. So I order what I thought was the graphic novel, turns out it is more \"novel\" and less \"graphic\". It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think \"BANG!\" \"POW!\" or \"ZORT!\" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name. His physiognomy is dead on as well, like in all comics, it let's us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all. Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars."],[0,"Get to the point already","Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it."],[0,"Slow moving predictable story","The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres."],[1,"Good book if you look into it.","The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this \"perfect\" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her \"lover's\" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."],[1,"Great!!!!!READ ME READ ME READ ME!!!","Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood."],[0,"Horrific forced reading","I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other \"classic\" stories that could be included in the curriculum."],[0,"I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop!","I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!"],[0,"I don't get it.","I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me."],[0,"I hate this book.","This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust."],[1,"its as if I were reading the book itself.","I got the auido book cuz I didn't have time to read the book for my english report and exam. I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam. I did better listen than reading."],[0,"Way too boring for me","My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class. I consider this cruel and unusual punishment. I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel! Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne."],[0,"Great plot, horrible writing!!!!!!!!","I believe that the plot of \"The Scarlet Letter\" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style. Sometimes it just dragged on forever & I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue---I couldn't enjoy a book like that. I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!"],[0,"get it away","I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read!

What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!"],[0,"Overrated Pretentious Trash","This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is."],[1,"The Scarlet Letter","One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time."],[1,"A classic novel with a contemporary message","Hawthorne's masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed. It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as \"sinners\" are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Best (or worst) of all, the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life. Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter 'A' on his chest for the rest of his term."],[1,"Each read is like peeling layers of a rose","What greater journey than to delve into the human heart? Every emotion one can nurture there is here, bared and examined.Hester, at once forthright and complex, serves as our guide, as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart.That we can fall, sin, disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day."],[1,"A better read as an adult -- not a great choice for teenagers...","Well-paced, surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used. I hadn't read it in 30 years, and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager. There must be a lesson in there somewhere...\""],[0,"Don't pay for this on the Kindle","Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."],[1,"Strong Woman","200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period."],[0,"Slow, Overwritten Drama","It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen."],[0,"Great Story ... Bad writing","So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library."],[1,"Wonderful, wonderful","Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise."],[0,"Awful","I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word \"Classic\" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was \"meaty\" (whatever that is), \"deep\", and \"powerful\"; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."],[0,"So boring","I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring."],[0,"The okay book","Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."],[0,"I HATE THIS BOOK","I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."],[0,"Don't READ THIS BOOK!!","THIS BOOK SUX!

I read only 6 of the chapters and then gave up . Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it - but it has nothing to do with modern life.And to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless. Like I really care about what happenes to Hester. I've failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same. Its one of those books where you read 4 pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today. Then i have to read the pages all over again.

Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."],[0,"I only gave it a star because I had to.","This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good.

I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling.

The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone."],[0,"Save Yourself","I agree 100% that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer. But this book was horrible. A simple phrase of action (Hester walking down the street) would be 4 pages of reflection. I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck, J.D Salinger, Mark Twian. I hated this book.

Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.)

Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too.

It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."],[0,"hate this new format","I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways.

While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints.

The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."],[0,"Leave this one to the bibliophiles","Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid.

I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a \"Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy\".

I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book."],[0,"Both forward and backward in its ideas","First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered \"a classic,\" such as Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."],[0,"I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him","Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book.

I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity."],[0,"it was very slow.","Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century, however, this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter.

Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \"The Custom House,\" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway."],[1,"Useful for AP Lit","I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature."],[1,"Timeless Classic","I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \"A\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \"Angel\" instead of \"Adulterer.\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."],[1,"One of the Greatest Books Ever Written","The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written."],[0,"Does not have true plumeria scent","I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis.

I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel.

It's a daring movie that take a rare look at what we've been missing in today's corperate -hectic (kiss butt) culture. And that is emotional honesty. It's like a release, a drug, or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are, and not necessarily how we act in everyday life.

This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it."],[0,"Spare yourself.","This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it, but there are always exceptions.If you're looking for a sweet Christmas tale, watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. If you're looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a \"moral\" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it.

One reviewer states, \"the funniest Christmas movie ever\". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it."],[0,"Clean it up!","The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end."],[0,"1 star, since there's no \"zero stars\" available","I can't believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes.

Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever).

The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it). Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating, but that's Sandler's great gold."],[0,"Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie!","This movie was terrible!\"WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!\"Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean.

Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable!

It was hilarious and Sandler's fans especially will be cracking themselves up. I must admit that it is very crude at parts, so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters, it probably isn't suitable for the young ones. Although, I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads.The message is good and the overall story has a message. I cried for Whitey, and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch. But it is HILARIOUS, from the triple breasted lady, to Whitey and his sister, to the deer (who's significance I really didn't understand).A must see for anyone <over 13> with a good (but stupid) sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs!"],[1,"Adam Sandler is Awesome","This movie is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better.

I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from \"Billy Madison\" to \"Punch-Drunk Love\". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for \"Eight Crazy Nights\". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last."],[0,"Nightmare Before Hannukah","I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this \"feature\" to anyone. \"Eight Crazy Nights\" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch \"Ishtar,\" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."],[0,"Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.","Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."],[0,"Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages","I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film."],[0,"To be honest....","To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible."],[0,"Sucks","Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."],[1,"return to forever proto-type","Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever, so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album. I always loved Corea with Farrell, because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe's flutes, sax, etc., like rain drops or storming. Nice soprano. And ELVIN JONES! I put this up up around the \"Joe Farrell Quartet\" album, and Buster William's bass is great, so much I don't miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland. A fresh sound, unparreled even now. It makes me want to see the Outback movie. The album cover is beautiful. Finally, the price is outstanding. Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way."],[0,"Inappropriate for young children","In two of the episodes, the word \"shut up\" is used.

As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."],[0,"Spun Out","The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged \"Adam And Evil\"); (2) Deborah Walley's \"girl drummer\" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues \"I'll Be Back\". Everything else is redundant."],[0,"The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs...","Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS!

She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."],[1,"Who else would have three beautiful women after him?","\"Spinout\" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In \"Spinout\" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on \"The Donna Reed Show\". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single."],[0,"Presley's Worst Film","\"Spinout\" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as \"I'll Be Back\" and \"Stop, Look and Listen.\" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."],[0,"The music's better than the movie","SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include \"Stop, Look, and Listen\" and \"I'll Be Back\".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."],[0,"NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY","This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions.

I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder.

The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle. After a few minutes, you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card, which gives you your nitrite level. It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point."],[1,"Great Buy!","This item arrived well packed and undamaged.

Thanks."],[1,"very nice","This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!"],[1,"Very Satisfied","I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much"],[1,"Great value for good quality product","Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger."],[1,"If it's good enough for Popeye...","I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person.

I was sceptical however, after reading reviews for this recording. After listening to it, all of my fears were put aside. This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director. I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung. Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent. A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees!"],[0,"Cheap and dangerous","Though I've had this only about a month, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Do NOT buy.Other better brands include Unicorn (recommended by a famous cooking magazine), Peugeot, Firth, and William Bounds."],[0,"Skip it - buy the full sized version","This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything."],[0,"Slow","I bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder."],[0,"Multilevel marketing meets education","I had to purchase this book for a community college class I'm taking. As a \"textbook,\" it has been a complete disappointment. The \"science\" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like \"you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education\" (straight from page 8!). Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from. The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch. In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting \"certified\" in Mr. Jensen's unique, \"empirically unproven\" techniques."],[1,"Well-Researched, easy to read, practical","Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more! He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read. I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it, too, for the students' sake!"],[0,"\"Pop\" psychology at its worse...","...Mr. Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops, seminars, presentations, publications, certifications -- if you've got the money then they have something to sell you...and all of it is centered around what is termed \"brain-based learning\"...but what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations...for example, it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and, hence, classrooms should be painted yellow...however, he doesn't offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up...it's all just ridiculous...how does this stuff ever make it into print?"],[1,"Get off the dead horse of \"old school\" education","To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so \"no child is left behind\" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a \"fad\", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of \"accountability\" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in \"leveling the field\" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of \"survivalists of poverty\". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to \"get off the dead horse\" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."],[1,"Easy read for brain information","This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint."],[0,"Fuzzy around the edges","I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:\"Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain\" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?"],[0,"Brain Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching","I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book. The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room. Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy."],[1,"Brain based Learning","This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon."],[0,"Pop psychology at its worst","I find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff. He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of mid-air, supposedly based on the brain research. If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this, read it carefully. He jumps to conclusions with little to no evidence to back it up. Plus, he is neither a teacher nor a neurologist. He just found something he can write about and sound like an expert. Plus the writing seems written for, we'll, let's say, young readers. Very simplistic, which is not always bad, but in this case, it is.Again, read carefully. Analyze his statements and look for the actual scientific proof for them. You will be hard-pressed to find any, either in his book or elsewhere.

It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The best soundtrack ever to anything.</td><td>I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Amazing!</td><td>This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of \"Prisoners of Fate\" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in \"A Distant Promise\" and \"Girl who Stole the Star\" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like \"Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~\", \"Time of the Dreamwatch\", and \"Chronomantique\" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent Soundtrack</td><td>I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it</td><td>If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>an absolute masterpiece</td><td>I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Buyer beware</td><td>This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a \"worst book\" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Glorious story</td><td>I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A FIVE STAR BOOK</td><td>I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Whispers of the Wicked Saints</td><td>This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Worst!</td><td>A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great book</td><td>This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Read</td><td>I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Oh please</td><td>I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Awful beyond belief!</td><td>I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a \"lean\" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.</td><td>It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A romantic zen baseball comedy</td><td>When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about \"BY THE SEA\". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fashionable Compression Stockings!</td><td>After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High</td><td>Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>sizes recomended in the size chart are not real</td><td>sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>mens ultrasheer</td><td>This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Delicious cookie mix</td><td>I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Another Abysmal Digital Copy</td><td>Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere \"out there\" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens</td><td>I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the \"New Young\" of Japan seem to be creating an \"international\" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>i liked this album more then i thought i would</td><td>I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like \"blue angel\",\"lanna\" and 'mama\" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Problem with charging smaller AAAs</td><td>I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Works, but not as advertised</td><td>I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a \"backup\" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointed</td><td>I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Oh dear</td><td>I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but \"more than equal.\" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!</td><td>This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Incorrect disc!</td><td>I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a \"incorrect disc\" message.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>happy with it...but</td><td>I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>should be titled \"Hollywood Debacle\"</td><td>The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Is this great TV??? You bet it is</td><td>Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie \"Glitter\" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Nothing you don't already know</td><td>If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.</td><td>When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last \"vibe\" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rochelle explains It All for You</td><td>Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>More great playing</td><td>Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on \"My Funny Valentine\" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Doesn't work on a Mac</td><td>It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system.

Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very Frustrating</td><td>My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the \"power-up segments\" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Mind numbing</td><td>This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Cannot recommend</td><td>As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Alaska sourdough</td><td>REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Old and good</td><td>This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>autumn</td><td>got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago</td><td>One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Maybe I got a bad one.</td><td>My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sylvania 6620LDG 20\" Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player</td><td>Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS</td><td>I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>*** BEWARE ***</td><td>This TV is set so that it is not capable of a \"recall\" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kitchen TV</td><td>I bought this to replace a 13\" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Nice for the money</td><td>The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointed Romanian!</td><td>This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is \"clean and proper\" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are \"tourist guides\" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great travel guide to Europe!</td><td>This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not the best</td><td>I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good but received defective book</td><td>I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>From The Label:</td><td>From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.</td><td>Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2\" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hunting the Hard Way</td><td>Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointing</td><td>The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Homer or Moses?</td><td>An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very poor quality.</td><td>The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The \"finish\" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Scraped across the whole top.</td><td>Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>unknown Africa</td><td>You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Didn't live up to expectations.</td><td>I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Profound then. Truly horrible now.</td><td>The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Definitely enjoyed!</td><td>This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Even Mommy has fun with this one!</td><td>My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great combination of creativity and adventure</td><td>My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rapunzel</td><td>This is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it. I like to play to if they would let me! So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game. Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be. Great fun for all!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>[Not what I expected]</td><td>... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>barbie rapunzel = crying child</td><td>My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to \"explore somewhere else in the castle.\"Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is \"currently disabled.\" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure</td><td>I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Use your imagination!</td><td>My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by \"decorating\" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not so good - ok for a rental!</td><td>This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one \"castle\" for the kids to \"decorate\" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the \"castle\" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC</td><td>NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bad Deal!!</td><td>I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Smells divine.</td><td>This is my second bottle of sheer freesia, I just love this fragrance, its a light delicate sent, beautiful, like a summer day.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very disappointed!</td><td>This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Creepy</td><td>Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>audio options non existent</td><td>While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the \"non existent\" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sooo JAMMIN', too trill</td><td>Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dirty South</td><td>This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good book</td><td>Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it.

This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It Drew Air</td><td>This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>comfy,warm.. but run big</td><td>just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Buyer Beware!!</td><td>I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ariel Litte Mermaid with pearl kit</td><td>Arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however I wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions!!!! I should have listened to the other reviews.... If you are hoping to get more than the topper DO NOT BUY THIS!! So annoyed I have this Ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No instructions included - do not trust seller</td><td>Promised with this item are \"Complete Instructions\" and the additional pledge that \"Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!\" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!</td><td>I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their \"rock\" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their \"2 Many DJs\" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, \"Nite Versions\" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release \"Nite Version\" on 12\" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming \"Sexor\" debut...?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>OMG Soulwax owns</td><td>wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going \"wow\".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Slow dull \"classical\" 1980's style movie</td><td>2 stars of 5 for this slow dull \"classical\" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Thank you for Releasing it!!!!!</td><td>I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very Not Worth Your Time</td><td>The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very fun and educational</td><td>Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ludicrous and silly</td><td>I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Artistry</td><td>I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Caution!</td><td>These tracks are not the \"original\" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are \"remastered\" or not is irrelevant.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>textbook</td><td>Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a great book for Historical romance lovers</td><td>This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>YES!!!</td><td>When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not the best in the series</td><td>Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance</td><td>I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too Uncomfortable and Too Big</td><td>These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very authentic</td><td>This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not the best</td><td>I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Doesn't Fit</td><td>I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You need a good memory</td><td>I play this with my grandchildren. It teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all. You sometimes miss the most obvious. Lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!</td><td>My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the \"Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!\" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, \"train\" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Loads of fun!</td><td>My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>easy and fun for 3-4yr olds</td><td>fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue.

But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all..</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I got fooled...</td><td>I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I got fooled...</td><td>I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation.

After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Worth the wait!</td><td>JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. \"Goes Good With Beer\" and \"Little Devil\" would be great singles to spice up country radio. \"Letters From Home\" deserves to be single of the year and \"Cool\" is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>letters from home</td><td>i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>no good</td><td>I gave it 5 stars because my little dog had so much fun riping it apart but only took him 24 hrs to do it buy that is 23 hrs longer than other balls</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>ESTE LIBRO CONTIENE TODO</td><td>LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CUÑADOS...¡Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Oh!</td><td>This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Delicious and Addictive</td><td>This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone?</td><td>I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that \"the site who has everything including a church\" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of a kind book for timber frame building.</td><td>My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>no technical information</td><td>this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hanford Mills museum</td><td>My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>you will not be able to buils a timber frame house</td><td>This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Outstanding guidebook for building your own timberframe home</td><td>My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Excellent book, very poor e-book editing</td><td>Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A very good how-to manual.</td><td>If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool</td><td>These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in \"hot\" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, \"well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.\"Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Graphics!</td><td>2006 Coast to Coast for PC is great! The graphics are awesome... The game is what I had hoped for and a lot more!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985</td><td>Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to \"Battlefield\". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My Henry</td><td>I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Henry has come home...</td><td>I had Henry back in the early 70's. I am forty now and still have my original. I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance. Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancer.Thanks for making him again.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Charisma</td><td>What it is about \"Henry Dog\". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an \"incurable\" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a \"real\" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14\" and 3\". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle \"Henry Dog`s\" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I found it! Henry Dog!</td><td>I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found \"him\", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to Delight!</td><td>While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches</td><td>Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>great gift</td><td>my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Product didn't match the picture/description</td><td>Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Good for a laugh</td><td>I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>As Bad a Production as Possible</td><td>This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not professional quality</td><td>I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>three to four stars - depending...</td><td>Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Good songs, bad cover.</td><td>This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by \"the Starlite Singers\".</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>New Wave 80s</td><td>I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the \"Starlite Singers\". The description of the record says that it is by \"various artists\" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't Be Fooled!</td><td>I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!</td><td>This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!</td><td>Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>BEWARE!!</td><td>Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>80's High Tech with Rock Emotion</td><td>Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song \"Curious Kind\" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Never gets going</td><td>This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Now, The Rest of the Story</td><td>I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The baseball benchmark</td><td>I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all. I know, I have been subscribed for 2 years now, and I can't think of living without it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Perfect for the die-hard baseball fan</td><td>I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>\"Uh oh he's been using Brand X\"</td><td>An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real \"fusion\" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny.</td><td>I read \"Trouble on Titan\" around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy \"Trouble on Titan.\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Peek a Fun!</td><td>We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent product</td><td>These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Great for Twins</td><td>I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>They're blocks - keep that in mind</td><td>We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can \"spin\" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a \"look at me\" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Would have expected better!</td><td>I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cute gift for a little baby</td><td>Although I felt it looked a bit chinsy, the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Blocks</td><td>My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Awesume! BEST BLOCKS EVER!</td><td>THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>keeps his attention</td><td>My little boy is just getting interested in these blocks. They are too cute! He's learning to manipulate the block in his hands. The little things inside the blocks are adorable. Some spin, some twirl, some rock. A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great value.</td><td>This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful but not worth $80.</td><td>These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed $79.99. They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Worth the investment</td><td>This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the \"fun\" factor. For younger babies that may not \"get it\" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>waste off money</td><td>this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy</td><td>The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>small didn't work</td><td>It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Makes for fascinating reading.</td><td>Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Pretty Nifty!</td><td>I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yet another unsubstantiated case....</td><td>While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Molly Myers</td><td>Molly Myers, in her review of \"My Name is Rachel Corrie,\" describes the ISM as \"an organization dedicated to non-violence.\" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM \"pacifists\" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep \"innocent Palestinians\" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Gardening lawn book</td><td>Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It's a knock off.</td><td>The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading \"FX\", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just a few.</td><td>These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as \"sealed Door\", \"wings across time\" or \"At the Bottom of the Night\".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It was \"ok\" but I won't watch it again</td><td>I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!)</td><td>I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>mask maker</td><td>It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>mask maker</td><td>I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>NOT the worst American B-Movie</td><td>This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>MASK OF FAMILIARITY</td><td>MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unmasked..................</td><td>Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A museum exhibit inside a book</td><td>This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great resource for Chinese/Eastern medincine</td><td>This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you are unhappy with it, I will be happy to purchase it from you as I have many peers that would happily use it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Why Is This A Good Book?</td><td>As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Book That Is Worth a Second Look</td><td>This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Best game ever</td><td>This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Guitar in Absentia</td><td>With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Stiff and Smells like drying paint</td><td>You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Review of Pillow</td><td>This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't bother</td><td>The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worthless and cheap</td><td>How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Will not be purchasing another one of these</td><td>It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>False Advertisement</td><td>The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not Like the Old Formula</td><td>The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>haven't found better yet...</td><td>This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>smoothing serum</td><td>The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The product I received this time is like fake one</td><td>I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If it ain't broke don't fix it</td><td>I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum</td><td>I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the \"Controlgel\" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the \"Controlgel\" is out of production. This \"Smoothing Serum\" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the \"Controlgel\" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the \"Controlgel\" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the \"Smoothing Serum.\" What a WASTE!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>LOVE IT!</td><td>I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Best !!!!</td><td>Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great control racquet</td><td>A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!</td><td>My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bad skating technique</td><td>I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A complete waste</td><td>My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks</td><td>I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Barbie's Boring Ice Show</td><td>I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS</td><td>This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>IT'S GREAT!</td><td>All the other reviews say this product is boring and \"save your money\"....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater \"never falls\"?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A good game to buy.</td><td>I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the \"frustration factor\", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a \"5\" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the \"easy\" and \"medium\" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Game</td><td>My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not really what I wanted</td><td>For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called \"Perfect Gentleman\" with 2 titles on it: \"Ooh la la\" and \"One more Chance\". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rare find</td><td>A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Fire Truck Puzzle</td><td>The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dark Horses a must have CD</td><td>I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous</td><td>What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't waste your money</td><td>I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Does not work!</td><td>It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Plug it in and it works!</td><td>Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works!

Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Beautiful Love Story</td><td>I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is \"This is a paranormal disaster area!\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Best Yet!!!</td><td>Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Best</td><td>I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Soul-mates</td><td>I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Possibly the Best out of this series!</td><td>It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Amazing!</td><td>LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the best books I've ever read!</td><td>DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST</td><td>I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of her best in the Night World series!</td><td>Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer</td><td>I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I'm hooked and I want some more ...</td><td>I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called \"Daughters of Darkness\" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>L.J. Smith has so many correct details....</td><td>I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>It was great!!!</td><td>I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointing</td><td>I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>mirroring the reader</td><td>I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't Waste Yout Time</td><td>Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information</td><td>To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....</td><td>Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A rare & wondeful treat</td><td>I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>nifty</td><td>It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!</td><td>Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very annoying!</td><td>This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus \"feature\" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Extremely Disappointed with this video</td><td>I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the \"Sing A Long\". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just so-so</td><td>This is a DVD with footage of a \"Come Out and Meet Thomas\" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the \"party/interview\" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much</td><td>I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A long promo for the Thomas center(s)</td><td>Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poor DVD</td><td>Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My Son finds it annoying</td><td>My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Feels like a commercial...</td><td>All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Makes you not want to sleep at night.....</td><td>This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site</td><td>This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this \"$25,000\" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great little surge protector</td><td>Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too Small</td><td>I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the \"stretch\" waist band they are tight. So much for an \"extra\" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A good product available in convenient range of sizes</td><td>This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>TOM ATKINSON REVIEW</td><td>I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Cut smaller than usual</td><td>I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wrong item sent.</td><td>I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too bad....</td><td>Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dockers do the job.</td><td>This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>False advertising</td><td>If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't Trust the Images</td><td>Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. \"Cafe,\" for example, should be \"Coffee.\" Despite the fact that the image for \"Cafe\" shows a stone or very light gray color, \"Cafe\" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So disappointed</td><td>I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are \"deals\" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fantastic Book</td><td>This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disturbing</td><td>Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Taste of Italy</td><td>Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Perfect book for a long flight....</td><td>.... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Delicious reading</td><td>I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a \"trifle overdone\" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy</td><td>THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...</td><td>This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the best!</td><td>If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cameriere!</td><td>I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard \"chick lit\" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to \"Roman young stud\" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than \"Cooking for Mr. Latte\" - it was a fun read.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way</td><td>I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>\"Chick Lit \" for \"Foodies\"</td><td>What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not very good....</td><td>I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Do not waste your time....lousy</td><td>This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is \"the best ever experienced\" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The food is sexier than the sex</td><td>This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Back to basics</td><td>Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>CASH MONEY AND NO LIMIT ARE THA SAME THANG!</td><td>THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just as trashy as garbage music comes...</td><td>I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words \"huh,\" \"what,\" and \"yeah\" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what \"so-called\" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>this album is garbage,straight bfi material</td><td>cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I feel ya \"Ghenry187@aol\"...this CD rocks. No Limit can't...</td><td>I feel ya \"Ghenry187@aol.com\"...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is \"Help\" by B.G. I love this CD.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>save your $$$</td><td>I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the \"we on fire\" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more \"bounce\" party tracks like \"back that ass up\" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS CD!</td><td>I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Worst music ever....but I love it.</td><td>I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>classic</td><td>most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>NO, NOT 5 STARZ 6 STARZ!</td><td>this album hea is just \"too hot\". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys \"Guerilla Warfare\". like i said in the beginning \"not 5 starz 6 starz\", if you know what i mean!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>THIS IS A ONE COMPARED TO JUVENILEZ 400 DEGREEZ</td><td>ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The worst rap I ever Heard</td><td>This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>super hot</td><td>lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>super wack</td><td>just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ghetto foolishness</td><td>i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is \"we on fire\" and \"I need a hot girl\". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Please try another Hot Boy album...</td><td>Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fun To Listen To.</td><td>This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 \"I Need A Hot Girl\", \"We On Fire\", \"Respect My Mind\" & \"Tuesday & Thursday\". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? \"Ridin'\" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like \"Clear Tha Set\" by Lil'Wayne. \"Ya Dig\" by Juvenile. \"Help\" by B.G., and \"Bout Whatever\" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. \"Too Hot\" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Did you like 400 degreez?</td><td>A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. If you aren't down w/ C.M.B yet, go get 400 degreez first. If you already got and you love it, this is just another hour of banging bump and car music. Great</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This CD iz Aight...........</td><td>FIRST OF ALL HOW COME ALL YA'LL BE DISSIN' NO LIMIT (for all ya'll that did not diss em' dis ain't for you) WHAT YA'LL TALKLIN ABOUT CASH MONEY CAN NEVER GET WITH NO LIMIT AND THAT IS A FACT.....

I just wish it was a little cheaper.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Book review</td><td>This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Novel as Enjoyable as the Restaurant Antoine's</td><td>If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called \"Madame Castel's Lodger,\" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>An old friend</td><td>This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NOT A RIDE ON</td><td>I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent - Very Useful</td><td>I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful. A thorough reference guide.</td><td>I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fantastic Advanced Course!</td><td>Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Simply excellent !!! No Comparision</td><td>I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help. The topics have been beautifully explained. HTML, XML, CSS,DHTML are no longer nightmares for me. I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs. This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML. I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference. The book is worth buying. This is worth 5+ star rating.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Complete reference... yes</td><td>Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good place to start Web development</td><td>It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Keeps me healthy and I am not allergic to this brand.</td><td>I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Thoughtful, contemporary fiction</td><td>Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Why Some People Complain</td><td>The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My Daughter Hates It</td><td>I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>glider</td><td>the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>bench</td><td>The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Glider</td><td>We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Gauges in chair arms</td><td>Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very nice glider</td><td>Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fantastic glider/ bench</td><td>Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>James Moody takes San Diego \"Beyond the Border\"!</td><td>James Moody, and his well known \"cast of characters\" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've \"never heard it played like THAT before\".</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Seal IV</td><td>I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Woburn: Forgotten Tales & Untold Stories</td><td>I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too Much on the Mystical Plate</td><td>The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>God's Zoo</td><td>Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Different</td><td>The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Awesome</td><td>This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>An interesting little essay</td><td>Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Actors - Well done film!</td><td>Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the \"in-laws\" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live \"Happily Ever After\". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great movie, not so great DVD</td><td>This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of \"boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married\" this movies looks at the question of \"then what?\" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>an extreme emotional ride</td><td>If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Grrrrr. Arrrrgh.</td><td>We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I give it 5 stars because it's entombed</td><td>I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, \"uprising\". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>bye bye mom and dad</td><td>My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Bass - voice delight in jazz music</td><td>Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Danelectro DJ-20C Rocky Road Spin Speaker Mini Effects Pedal</td><td>This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fabulous...</td><td>This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!!</td><td>OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.TO THE ONES THAT HAVE MS.FEEHAN'S OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION, TO HER FINE WORK.TO THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES .THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MS.FEEHAN WORK.NICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFUL,THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END,ONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDE.A KEEPER .....4 STARS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful!!!</td><td>Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A change from the Carpathian Series</td><td>The heroine, Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the \"pounce on each other in the first chapter\" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Riveting</td><td>I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special \"gifts\" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has \"gifts\" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the \"I hate you!\" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not her best...........</td><td>Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This one is missing that Feehan Spark</td><td>This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a \"mystery\" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Intriguing story</td><td>While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>amazing</td><td>I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too Boring</td><td>This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more \"Dark Series\" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-(</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ick ack. Put it back.</td><td>I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, \"leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to\". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>disappointed</td><td>i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not up to scratch!</td><td>I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>WONDERFUL GOTHIC</td><td>I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER..... CONGRATULATIONS</td><td>CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN... THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES... WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT - TO SPARK THE INTEREST... OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS. IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING - WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE END...TRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME - WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS.. I LOVED IT... AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.... CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC - OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER.. WELL DONE..</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>An Old World change that's definitely wonderful</td><td>The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Reading</td><td>Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I really wish i hadn't wasted my time</td><td>First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Couldn't finish it</td><td>I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poor support</td><td>I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very Good</td><td>Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great for the money</td><td>The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Low resolution and poor quality</td><td>I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Better than some out there.</td><td>My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between \"soft\" and \"loud\" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fun toy!</td><td>My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel and Unusual</td><td>Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can't wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can't wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer.........RKsbabydoll</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good Deal and Fast Shipping</td><td>I bought this book used and it was in very good condition. Also, I received it within a week, which was nice.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>2/3 of a great book, then... blah</td><td>I listened to the audio version of \"Cruel & Unusual\" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the \"who\" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, \"great book, bad ending...\" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Review</td><td>This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love Scarpetta</td><td>You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A really bad book</td><td>Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no \"grab\" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, \"I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.\"Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>formula type writing</td><td>My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just Plain Cruel Will Do</td><td>I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel and Unusual</td><td>A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I guess it was a mystery</td><td>In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Inproper Advertising</td><td>I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Solid Addition to the Series</td><td>Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Still Loving Scarpetta</td><td>I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to \"bog-down\" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great</td><td>Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Another one done!!!</td><td>Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel and Unusual</td><td>The book was excellent. I was barely able to put it down. I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Muddled ending disapoints</td><td>The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Spellbound!</td><td>This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very nice book</td><td>I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too scattered, too shallow</td><td>Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Soooooooooooo NOT Funny</td><td>This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Totally Unfunny</td><td>When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say \"What on earth is this?...\" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Nasty People! Nasty Film!</td><td>Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>zero star</td><td>those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Dramedy</td><td>This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Not so Funny People</td><td>I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 movie/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. I should have walked out like so many others did.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>What happend Sandler?</td><td>His movies seem to be going down hill. The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it. Other then that, it is just not that funny. Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>serious comedy</td><td>FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Long, somewhat dull and unfocused</td><td>This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about \"comedy\" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?</td><td>Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying \"tweet\" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look</td><td>Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.</td><td>Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not so Funny people!</td><td>Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved \"Knocked Up\" and \"40 Year Old Virgin\" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for \"Bruno\" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best</td><td>An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really \"funny people\" involved movies, like \"ANGER MANAGEMENT\" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious \"LITTLE NICKY\".</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not what I expected...</td><td>I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Couldn't give it less than one star....or i would've!!!!</td><td>Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it. Like i said, not much to say....i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 3.99 back!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Absolutely NOTHING Funny !</td><td>This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst movie I've ever seen</td><td>This movie was HORRIBLE! I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life. I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie. I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once. Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them it's a waste and to rent something else.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>worst film ever</td><td>I saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago. i said to her, this is real stupid, i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending. She said, \"we saw this movie already\" and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument, she claims WE saw it and i said, Vat ? i am getting alzheimers?Finally we figured it out. we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out.adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies. but this one really eats the bird!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The L O N G E S T movie... EVER!</td><td>Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!</td><td>i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Seth Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!!</td><td>A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Stupid....</td><td>Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Sandler's worst!</td><td>I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not good</td><td>The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in.......</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>GIFT</td><td>I bought this for a Christmas present for my son. It arrived in perfect condition. He loves Adam Sandler and collects all his movies.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>waste of time</td><td>I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Depressing then becomes boring</td><td>my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Please just run far FAR away from this film.</td><td>It is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless. Some may call it \"complex\"; but I call it crap. There are a few little laughs here and there - but nothing that would make this worth sitting through. Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious content.....it still sucks. Don't waste your money. Watch \"I love you man\" or \"Grandma's Boy\" or something that is actually entertaining. I wish someone had warned me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!</td><td>Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Moron</td><td>How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NOT FUNNY!</td><td>This is what Hollywood is calling humor these days? Must of been written by the lowly out of work writers during their strike! Crude, demeaning and a waste of my time!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Pretty pathetic people</td><td>The new \"stars of comedy\" make me miss the real ones. Why don't you try to learn from thy elders, like Mel Brooks, boys?Side note: Hollywood hasn't come up with real comedy since \"Meet the Spartans.\" Anybody who forgot how brilliant it was needs to watch again \"I Will Survive\" at the end of the Spartans (it might still be on Youtube: SidgzLnh_W4).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>great movie, movie is longer than 2hours</td><td>this is a great movie its not 40yr old virgin funny or knocked up funny but its a pretty good movie alot of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts 2 it. the only reason i think its not really funny is because theres none of those funny parts like knocked up of the 40yr old virgin has. dont pay attention to the reviews rent the movie or something if u like it buy it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Not entirely a comedy</td><td>I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Winning Cast, movie fell short</td><td>This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ACTUALLY NO STARS for rating pf Funny People movie</td><td>Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not Funny People</td><td>Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very inspirational</td><td>So I just watched Funny People. For a movie that has an all star cast, it was a great movie. If you want to see a movie filled with laughs and a good story pick this movie up. I promise you won't regret it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sfar's Best!</td><td>A delightfully funny story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Rabbi's Cat is the cat's meow!</td><td>This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A wonderful, funny-sad book</td><td>The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>good artwork too!</td><td>The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Delightful, exotic world seen through a cat's eyes</td><td>\"The Rabbi's Cat,\" by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Self-Serving Message</td><td>This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not what it looks like on the cover.</td><td>As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Last dissenting Witness</td><td>The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>See my article \"Jean Hill - The Lady in Red\" online</td><td>Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - \"Jean Hill -The Lady in Red\" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website. The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Drivel</td><td>Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the \"little dog\" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>An Ever expanding story followed by same ol same ol</td><td>Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another \"MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY\" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans. Originally I thought &#65533;The Assassination tapes&#65533; By George O&#65533;Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Uneducated Nonsense</td><td>The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as \"nonsense.\" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Swords for a Great Price!</td><td>I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really \"Wallhanger\" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Fraud,not as advertised</td><td>This DVD was entiled \"Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985\" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance.

Highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader</td><td>The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Best Patricia Cornwell's book</td><td>I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Kay Scarpetti is losing it.</td><td>Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If you can't say anything nice,</td><td>Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great read</td><td>This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>You have GOT to be kidding</td><td>This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My brain froze over</td><td>This supposed \"thriller\" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Losing her edge?</td><td>I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic \"grit\" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The devil in the detail</td><td>I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are \"as pale blue as a malamute's\", when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The pits . . . a contrived pot-boiler. Avoid it.</td><td>If you love meaningless running around, plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief, andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies, you might put up with this one. Otherwise . . . the book disappoints. One gets the impression that it was written in haste. A pale imitation of the previous work . . .deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables (if not in a Potter's Field for books).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So far, the worst book of one of my favorite authors</td><td>Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very Dissapointing</td><td>From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Intelligently written; a fast and suspenseful read.</td><td>I am on my 8th Scarpetta story. I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops.....Marino's gruff demeanor and language are so colorful...Dr. Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down...The development of Lucy's character is interesting, but it is time she, too, develop into a stronger person emotionally. Cornwell's work is, for me, as good as Grisham's.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>What a disappointment!</td><td>I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just awful</td><td>This was possibly the worst book I have ever read. I am amazed by the number of fans for this kind of rubbish.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A wildly implausible thriller</td><td>This book is so unrealistic that it spoils all the fun, super killers like Temple Gault (a clone for the Satan Incarnate known as Hannibal Lecter) are more silly than super. I found all the other character two dimensional and all the \"intrigue\" regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence. Has Cornwell done better? I don't know and, after reading this, am in no big hurry to find out.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>From Potter's field, buried with no name</td><td>Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI. When Temple Gault, a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier, resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park, Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation. The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority, and when it is discovered who she is, the investigation is spun into a radical new direction. Meanwhile, Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself...leading to one final, terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city.A fascinating book with wonderful characterization, grisly accuracy and a high-voltage, suspensful ending. The Scarpetta series is the best! When it comes to crime fiction, no one does it better than Cornwell.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability</td><td>This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read. She is a compelling storyteller, and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter. I do admit to finishing the book in a two-day period, but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer. Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well, but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical. I don't believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise, but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks.Since reading this book, I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one. This book is not her best that I've read so far, but it wouldn't prevent me from reading another one.This is a good, focused, and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No one will edit this, because I'm Patricia Cornwell</td><td>At least, that's how I felt about this book, which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels. I recommend the first three books in the series. I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling. However, not having a fireplace, I filed this under G.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>a let down</td><td>This books just didn't do it for me. I enjoy PC but this book. Seemed too easy. Things just happend, people just called. In fact, I think this books had some bad editing. I felt as though all what was needed was there, and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reason.I am still a fan, but this one is a skipper.The doc just happens, to see the resturante that the killer was using.The polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police. Just does not at add.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>To contrived and therefore not plausible</td><td>I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved. The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have. For example: The scene in which Gault (the killer) has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in. Imagine, in New York no less! Not only that, but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant. And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field. I'm sorry, but this tale is just to unbelievable. It might make a passable B grade film, but I wouldn't want to see it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Stilted and Hokey</td><td>This book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled! Jerky and clumsy with a very hollow ring to it. I read 1/3 of the book and threw it in the \"yard sale\" pile. It's the first book of hers I've read and I don't intend to pick up a second one. This is really a prime example of bad writing churned out for non-readers and quick profits.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Terror in Central Park</td><td>Here is a terrifying novel by Cornwell. Her knowledge of medicine and forensic science keeps you turning the page. A woman's body is found in the snow in Central Park. There is no question that the killer is one Temple Brooks Goult. Scarpetta discovers that his killings are a pattern with one ending. It is one of her best. By Ruth Thompson author of \"The Bluegrass Dream\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Patricia Cornwell rocks! Best mystery writer on record!</td><td>Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery. I've never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Rekindling Love</td><td>Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst English dub of a great TV series</td><td>This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A Piece of Crap!</td><td>Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No theory what so ever</td><td>The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no \"objective\" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>You sure can tell this was written by an accountant...</td><td>There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>wrong item</td><td>I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worthless</td><td>How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>There's no other book like this one!</td><td>There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't bother!</td><td>What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Lincoln and his time</td><td>For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Explains why economics and politics don't mix!</td><td>Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a brilliant, well-written economics primer</td><td>Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the \"common good.\" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't waste your money.</td><td>If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor \"mandatory reading\" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>More of a personal opinion than that of economics</td><td>When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not what it claims to Be</td><td>I was actually looking for a book on economics... This book is more of a conservative rant. It's not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics. Buy this book if you want to hear how much the author thinks liberalism stinks... not if you want \"Economics in one lesson.\" I definitely feel like I got tricked into buying it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The best book on Economics...</td><td>...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3.5 Stars-A useful supplementary text for lower division microeconomic principles courses only</td><td>This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Title is a Scam</td><td>When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NO Help</td><td>This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Polemic and Outdated</td><td>I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have \"the answer,\" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too simplistic</td><td>Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This ain't no economics book!</td><td>I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No lessons learned</td><td>This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Best book on Economics for the general reader</td><td>This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If you don't have this, get it!</td><td>This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication</td><td>I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Give this book to a your children.</td><td>Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON</td><td>Economics in One Lesson is another great \"must read\" book. Like Bastiat's \"The Law,\" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Never more needed than today</td><td>Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and \"higher education\" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Economics even you will Understand</td><td>For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Simply brilliant!</td><td>This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's \"Crashproof\" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!</td><td>As a student and teacher of economics, this book has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy (or any other arm of policy making, for that matter). Whether you agree with Hazlitt's conclusions about how the market works or not, you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book. It is entertaining to read, particularly easy for a book about economics. I highly recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Textbook</td><td>Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Our Senators and Reps should read and heed</td><td>This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Book</td><td>Very easy to read, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Painful</td><td>I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unsatisfactory and very outdated</td><td>I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book</td><td>The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading</td><td>This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses</td><td>If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Right-libertarian views presented as fact</td><td>The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to \"explode liberal myths\" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the \"successes\" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ASTOUNDING</td><td>It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book. It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>how to fail economics 101</td><td>This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid</td><td>Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as \"common sense.\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Back to basics...</td><td>Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A great alternative perspective</td><td>Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sanity in Economics</td><td>This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Fine Summary</td><td>This is a great primer that should be read in all schools. Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A good libertarian primer</td><td>This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Important</td><td>Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Economics</td><td>Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Frighteningly Prophetic</td><td>An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great book</td><td>This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great summary of some very difficult economic principles</td><td>This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an \"Adam Smith\" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>over-simplified diatribe</td><td>Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>More politics, less economincs</td><td>I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book's title is misleading.</td><td>This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Seriously Flawed</td><td>Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not a primer, way too political</td><td>Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Hazlitt has an opinion, and he presents it here. I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues, but more importantly, spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals.This book fails in that respect. Keep looking. (Samuelson, Mankiw, Malkiel...)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Straight to the trash can!</td><td>Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Pretty cool</td><td>Let me first say I'm into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). I have latelly been checking out the Euro scene of music(I don't know bought a Bmw could have been influencing me lol). I like this chick(not only cute) but she is cute and beats are catchy. Their music makes wanna make me drive fast. The older I get(30), the more I listen to beat and the complete way the music is put together. So liking the Goldfrapp stuff. So I by these cd's for my girl(while secretly ripping them to my zune). Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here. Good catchy cd, interesting use of instruments and keyboards. Did I mention she is cute little thing. Check out their videos they are a trip.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Allison rocks!</td><td>I have just recently discovered Goldfrapp and boy look at what I have been missing out on!This disc is incredible! My only gripe...it needs to be longer!Number 1 is an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such a shame that US radio does not play such a wonderous mix of techno & electronica on the airwaves, yet forces us to listen constantly to tired rap lyrics about hos and bling, dumb TV show contest winners and R&B; idiocy.Allison has them all beat, hands down!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kids love it</td><td>It's Thomas! Kids love it. I can tolerate him better than Barney or those Wiggles. Still sounds so odd to hear George Carlin narrating a children's movie...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great for kids!</td><td>As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Chocolate delicious by body hottie</td><td>this book was delicious it was very interesting i never knew most of this stuff in thereit made me so hungry for chocolate and im a chocolate fanaticDELCIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!even the book tasted good~~~ body hottie</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Stellar Kid's Tape!</td><td>This is not your average kid's tape! Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated movie!</td><td>I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>TMNT Soundtrack</td><td>I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Egbert is such a wonderful name</td><td>After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this book. This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>sweet musings for loss and love</td><td>Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Art of Chinese Medical Science</td><td>I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. I would call it an Art of Chinese Medical science.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>What more do I need?</td><td>Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder. I have webtv so I can capture all of the stills I need and do it quite easily and without software and a computer.Keep it simple stan is definitly my mantra and this camcorder helps me do just that. More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city. I wouldn't buy electronics on line again (been there done that). A longer battery life would be all I would ask for .</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A great American Sisters book.</td><td>Ten year old Erna Anderson and her sixteen year old sister Alfreda lived lives of poverty in Sweden. Their father went to America seven years ago, and finaly sent for Mother and their little brother Karl. But Karl had died, and Mother was ill, so Erna and Alfreda would have to make the journey to America alone, in third class on the Titanic. The two sisters, seperated at first by poverty and sorrow, soon become friends. But when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, can they survive?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>not quite what I was expecting</td><td>I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry</td><td>In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to \"feel\" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Nineteen folktales of South and Central America</td><td>This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is incomprehensible</td><td>This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It wasn't very good!</td><td>This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very boring</td><td>I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>on order</td><td>I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Long torso but great product</td><td>Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1\". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love This Item</td><td>I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Had some problems at first but now i love it</td><td>I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good choice for getting a vintage look</td><td>I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Squeem works well</td><td>I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too small - NO RETURNS</td><td>I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>wow</td><td>this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier!! Don't give up it is worth it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great!</td><td>I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wasn't what I expected</td><td>I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>great</td><td>provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a good smoother</td><td>I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Works Well!</td><td>I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I \"tried out\" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me \"back fat\" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two \"size options\" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your \"natural\" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my \"under/side boob\" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>squeem cincher</td><td>Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>not really worth it</td><td>I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great product; great seller!</td><td>I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Painful Experience</td><td>I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Product!</td><td>Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down. I've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>poor fit</td><td>After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not recommended!</td><td>When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around</td><td>The product did what it was \"supposed to\" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Advertized as \"New\" but arrives worn out</td><td>Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as \"New\" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as \"New\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great results, with some side effects...</td><td>I have one of those \"spare tire\" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to \"make\" me look trimmer...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles</td><td>Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Upset</td><td>I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down...</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Falling apart</td><td>When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to \"right-sized\" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>ahi</td><td>I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Incrediby difficult to put on</td><td>With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Squeem</td><td>I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A bit uncomfortable...</td><td>I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the one</td><td>I'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. I love that you can't see it under clothes. I notice my back feel better with it on, my posture improves, and I look good in my clothes. I love this!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>really love it.</td><td>Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wow!</td><td>All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not the shape I was going for....</td><td>I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my \"excess\" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bones</td><td>This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Magic</td><td>After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wrong item shipped!!!!!</td><td>I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress. Unfortunately, they shipped the WRONG thing, and now I am stuck with a big, bulky and hideous vest! It has very ugly racerback straps, and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress. And the worst part, I'm out the money! I can't even return it for a refund, even though I haven't opened the box. VERY disappointed in this company. Buyer beware!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Sizing is Ridiculous</td><td>I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So what is the sizing?</td><td>I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Causes sweat that makes it unwearable!</td><td>This corset makes me Sweat like a hog, I am not I'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape, was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it, because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable, hot and sweaty underneath. This was bad for my skin too, it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods. It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I'd want to take it off immediately, so I never wore it, and just gave up and returned it. Still looking for a perfect corset, this however is NOT it. Don't waste your time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>best money I ever spent on shape wear</td><td>I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed \"WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist\"...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>works great</td><td>Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Great at first...not so good over time</td><td>Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Recommend this</td><td>I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape. I had a slimmer waist within weeks. You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on. It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to, but I would wear it only while working out. Otherwise, I would take it off.19 years later, after having my second child, I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it. I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts. It is well made and sturdy. The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising. I recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>boning is not a plus</td><td>It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. It also folds in with the fold of my stomach, which I didn't want, so it doesn't get that pooch area as well as I would've liked. I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good, thats about it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Pass</td><td>The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love this!</td><td>I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poor quality</td><td>I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression</td><td>I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the \"Extra firm compression\". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not the best shaper</td><td>This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It works, BUT....</td><td>My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>squeem</td><td>I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Product defective after 1 day of use</td><td>The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a great buy!</td><td>after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No,No,No This is not for me.....</td><td>I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Can't Go Wrong With This Item!</td><td>I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Would be great but...</td><td>The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:(</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>works but uncomfortable</td><td>Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Major let down!</td><td>I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Awsome!!</td><td>Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wasnt worth</td><td>I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :(</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!!</td><td>I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not so much</td><td>Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Burn Rubber on Me</td><td>I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not worth the price...</td><td>I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Torture</td><td>Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Squeem</td><td>The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I'm very impressed so far</td><td>So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach \"pooch\". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Not for everyone</td><td>I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a \"flat\" stomach just flabby and then I have \"love handles\" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Squeem:> A Combination of Scream and Squeeze?</td><td>I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. The first couple of wearings were difficult, but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me, I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter, as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping, but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep, rather than in the daytime, but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>excelent product!</td><td>This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hard to put on</td><td>The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Why does everybody rave when....</td><td>This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Uncomfortable!</td><td>It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Great idea, poor design</td><td>This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>best shapewear</td><td>it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Waste of time for me</td><td>I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not OK!!!</td><td>When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not worth the pain it causes</td><td>Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. However, I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound. Not worth the pain.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I love It!</td><td>it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. my grandmother even notice it, and she didn't even know i bought it. It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body. I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>disappointed</td><td>I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real \"waist trainer\", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for \"waist trainer\", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a \"cincher\" or a \"trainer\".</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>itchy</td><td>I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>i love it..</td><td>i realy love my shape wear, i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she's notice a big difference,</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wow, Ow and What's that smell?</td><td>I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9\" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>squeem is pretty good</td><td>i have a 28-29 inch waist normally. should've started with a size Small. the XS seemed a bit smaller than described. definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Snug Fit</td><td>Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poor quality and lousy customer service</td><td>The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!</td><td>Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem \"Magical\" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star. More worthy of steaming diarrhea.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very sturdy</td><td>This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worked for 5 days then broke</td><td>I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. it really flattens the tummy area, which is all I really want, but you can see the hooks threw clothes :( I felt like that ruined it for me, also I had to keep pulling it up. It bunches in the back, and really smells like rubber. After about 5 or 6 days one of the \"bones\" on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side! it really hurt. I would not recommend this product.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>does its job</td><td>recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color. could be little cheaper</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Squeem</td><td>Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>So Far So Good!</td><td>I've only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. This really holds you in, its comfortable and I don't think it shows through your clothes! I highly recommend!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure</td><td>I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>simple quick fix</td><td>I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A must have...</td><td>This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses. It also offers great support for your back. It is perfect for everyday wear.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The squeem waist cincher</td><td>The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wasn't that impressed........</td><td>It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Squeeeeeze into your clothes</td><td>I really liked the Squeem. I'm a petite person, but have some love handles that I need to hide when I'm wearing tight clothes. The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it's tight.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love it</td><td>This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27\" waist before pregnancy, 30\" waist when I bought a size medium, 28\" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted...</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good product</td><td>I read the reviews for this product and purchased. I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake. I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably. For me if I don't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don't feel it's working. The thing I like the most about it is that's it's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top. Body hugging tops excluded, of course. I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Waste of money</td><td>The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn't work as described on the advert. I've never been so sore (both side) in my entire life. I cannot wear it for more than 2h. Other then the product itself, the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 5-8 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later. What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didn't use correct stamp or pay the full charge. :@</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I got burned after few hours wearing it</td><td>the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>does not fit me!</td><td>So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering</td><td>I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Caused damage to my stomach muscles!</td><td>Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site. Now I'm in pain with and without it on.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great product</td><td>Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist. Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large. Looking to down size soon!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great product</td><td>Great fit. Does exactly what it is suppose to. Plan to buy more in different colors. Sent in good order.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love it!!</td><td>It was everything it was advertised to be. I'm going to get another one!!! Got so many compliments at the party that I wore it to. Made my outfit look really great!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>very good</td><td>this product is awesome. it hide all your secrets. I would recommend this product to all women and men. I will buy product again.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>It worked for me..</td><td>Thought this was not going to fit because I am a 44\" currently and I only ordered XL.. Like it very much</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not what I expected</td><td>This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too small</td><td>Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>perfect</td><td>Got this so I could start performing again(drag queen)and have put on a few pounds around the mid area, I didn't want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy. Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits, Works great and like they say pain is beauty, and this is so worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>AMAZING</td><td>I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing, trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Its amazing!!!</td><td>It really works! I am in love. I was trying to get my pre-pregnancy 21 in waist back for 10 months now. I got to 23in and kind of got stuck there. With Squeem I went from 23 in waist to 21in in just 2 minutes! Start hooking it from the top, much easier. Buy it! You won't regret!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty.

I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is Disgusting</td><td>The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous.

Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Ten gold bananas for Gorilla</td><td>Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla!

However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Edge of Danger</td><td>Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.It¡s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.It¡s obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins....</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Edge of Danger</td><td>1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Actually, this book is not worth one star.</td><td>This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not Worth The Reader's Time</td><td>It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointing and too simplistic</td><td>This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst Book I've Ever Read</td><td>This is simply the worst book I remember reading. I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels, so I happily picked this up. I'm sorry I did. It is nothing but action, which might be OK for a fun read on the beach, but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous. Massive action scenes (such as large battles) take place in only 1 or 2 pages. There's no character development, poor dialogue, no setting descriptions, no drama or suspense -- nothing but a poorly-described series of \"events\"! Enough said.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Formula Writing</td><td>I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, \"Edge of Danger\", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins</td><td>I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade</td><td>Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Writing on autopilot</td><td>After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Sophomoric at Best</td><td>Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. \"Damn, he said to Kate, \"It's the Hazar Scouts, \" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A Waste of Time</td><td>This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Plenty of action</td><td>This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Good story- Poor writing</td><td>Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Do I have to give it 1-star?</td><td>I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointment on every page</td><td>I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I would rather watch paint dry</td><td>Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Tired formula</td><td>Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is not the Jack Higgins I know</td><td>This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Completely predictable</td><td>Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>EXTREMELY SHALLOW</td><td>This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain</td><td>I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Can't believe I read the whole thing</td><td>Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...</td><td>Very few books contain their own review. This one does:\"Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'\"'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'\"This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A bad book, poorly written.</td><td>The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>higgins disappoints</td><td>This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Poorly Written</td><td>The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A Disappointment</td><td>It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. The writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. Save your money for something better.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Horrible</td><td>This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The \"adventures\" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the \"reliablity\" of the author.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not worth the effort</td><td>Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book</td><td>A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to \"speak Irish\" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointing and thin</td><td>I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out. Also there didn't seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded, and on the surface stupid, behaviour.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Two Hacks</td><td>I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Just skip it</td><td>When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst \"Live\" recording I've ever bought!</td><td>I bought this CD for one song only, \"Steal Away\". I knew it was going to be \"live\", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a \"muzik, lounge\" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was \"Hot Rod Hearts\", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most \"live\" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of \"Steal Away\"!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Different Collection of Early Stuff</td><td>This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)\". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to \"Love is Like a Cigarette\" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great reference</td><td>The book was good. Kept my interest. In no way am I finished reading it. It isn't a book to read from front to back. The information on each herb is detailed. Great reference material.

His entries are precise with magical associations, common names, and other names.. It also includes suggestions for use.Not only that but, it takes the time to explaint he various ways to use herbs.This is a wonderfull addition to any occult library..</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Has NO value!</td><td>If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own.

You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>needs $$ upgrade</td><td>Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Only Windows XP and earlier Support</td><td>This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars. If you have a car 2008 and later it doesn't show. Have to ask why they don't want to update the software for their products and still expect people to buy them.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>not very well written</td><td>This book was well reviewed and I was very disappointed.

It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A thorn in the side of literature.</td><td>Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Moral Novel with a Mystery</td><td>I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent Book</td><td>I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>technical problems with cassettes</td><td>This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Mundane, Tedious, Just Plain Boring</td><td>With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous \"A\" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's \"masterpiece.\" Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's \"A\" interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.</td><td>This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Absolute Waste of Time</td><td>My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A Tedious Read</td><td>I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Classic? Really?</td><td>I will never understand how \"Classics\" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book was OK............</td><td>The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I've read better.</td><td>I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Awakening.</td><td>This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlett Letter</td><td>Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected</td><td>I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Gripping</td><td>This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good read, but hard to navigate ebook</td><td>I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th</td><td>A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>love it</td><td>Book is a great read. Intriguing from start to finish. Cant find anything wrong to say. Would reccomend for beginer to advanced readers.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>remembered from High School (eons ago)</td><td>I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store - way to go Amazon!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Classic</td><td>I loved this book in high school, and I love it now. A tale of a strong woman that doesn't let society bring her down.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Typos</td><td>The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou</td><td>It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Boring</td><td>I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hi</td><td>D d this y c.f. thy f2f Hertzberg toughening bc.

I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Review From One Book At A Time</td><td>I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Amazingly Good</td><td>I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>interesting book</td><td>though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture..</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not my idea of a good read</td><td>I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Good book to read if you were bored to death!</td><td>I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A well written book!!</td><td>The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.</td><td>I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bad Book</td><td>This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Duller than dirt</td><td>I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I must say</td><td>that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>too hard to follow</td><td>the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.</td><td>I read this \"Classic\" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful classic</td><td>I enjoy this book very much. It is a timely classic with which I am happy to now have my own copy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Worth the effort</td><td>I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Puritanical ostracism</td><td>\"Easy A\" explains it best. If you can't relate in some way you must be a robot. Greatest book ever.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wasted Time</td><td>There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Tragic</td><td>Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great</td><td>Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>It's nice</td><td>it's nice. Very nice. Good indeed. I like it. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Exciting. Yes. Do you agree? Hester. Dimmesdale. Pearl. Chillingworth.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Classic tale</td><td>Loved this book as well. The movies as always stray from the book- I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Classic Worth Reading</td><td>My son had to read this for school and ended up really liking the story. It opened up dialog with us (his parents) about social situations, opinions and morality.I asked him about this review and he chose the review title and star rating.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!</td><td>Please, I beg of you, if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My favorite classic</td><td>Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. It's a classic, must-own for anybody that values the concept of reading. And if you didn't like it the first time, read it again and give it a second chance. I've read it about six times and it gets better each time. Cherish this book.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Scarlet Letter review</td><td>Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent romance in an excellent edition</td><td>Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature</td><td>I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Terrible book, do not read it.</td><td>Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz.....</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Meaningless Drivel</td><td>I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary. I have understood two chapters! I don't see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences! It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering. As I stated before, this is not my kind of book!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worst. Book. Ever.</td><td>It is my invariably correct opinion that the so-called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed, with EXTREME prejudice, for crimes against humanity and the English language.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Who Chooses Classics?</td><td>I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being \"one of the best novels ever.\" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, \"Ok, so what's the point?\" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>\"Hallelujah!\" is what I said when I finished this book</td><td>This novel was the most boring book I have ever read. I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a \"CLASSIC\"?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a must read</td><td>Everyone needs to read this classic. An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers. I really appreciated it a lot.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Teachers: This is not his best novel</td><td>Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of \"The House of the Seven Gables.\" Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed \"The Scarlet Letter,\" complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very good and very unlike the movie</td><td>I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie \"The Scarlet Letter\" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>not kindle ready</td><td>It's hard to put together any nice words about this transcription. It is not kindle ready, although it is textually complete. Should be a freebie.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>good</td><td>this book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so, all's well I guess, and the condition of the book was quite acceptable.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Boring, very</td><td>This book may have been one of the best books of the 19th century but its language and themes don't relate to us very much any more. The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end. I really disliked the book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Boring</td><td>My english teacher assigned this book, one I would never read on my own. I am a 16 year old and I enjoy reading. But this book, while it does have a few good points and messages, is incredibly dull. The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class. While this book has a rather good story it`s concealed by endless symbols and references, I suggest the cliff notes version!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Really Hard to Follow</td><td>This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow. Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn't understand them until they were pointed out to me. If you don't get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don't read it. There is a lot of symbolism in this book, too.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A fascinating look into another time's mores</td><td>Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>One word: outdated</td><td>This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call \"Old English\" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to \"New English.\" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I was fored to read it too</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book. I wouldn't tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan. This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description. His books wouldn't be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot. Now don't get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better. If you have to read it just deal with it. All I know is that is didn't hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>a tragedy</td><td>This is a tragedy in two ways. Everyone dies at the end, and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy.I can compare this book to a lobster.People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat.This book is a \"classic\" and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding.Avoid this book at all costs, if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>too had to read</td><td>I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read...haven't got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Simply the worse book ever.</td><td>I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>No Active Table of Contents</td><td>My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book. I really feel like I don't have any right to complain since the book was free but -you get what you pay for.The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for 18% of the book file. The actual text of the book doesn't start until location 604-10. Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning. It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Should not be a requirement in high school</td><td>To me this book would turn a young person, like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading . Being a book with extensive mistakes in it, it is very difficult to read unless you are to inerpret it every paragraph or should I say sentence. I't maybe a classic, but I feel that the word \"classic\" comes from just being old........................................................................................................p.s the only reason I put a star was because I had to, to express my opinion on he novel.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It was like a bad dream, but I couldn't wake up</td><td>This book is like a bad soap. No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Landscape book</td><td>I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape. I didn't think it was necessary, it's just a book right?I guess it's supposed to be easier to read in bed. I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book.If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns; first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom. This just seems really irritating to me.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN, TABOO</td><td>THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent gift</td><td>My 12 year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter. She has enjoyed reading it through out X-mas vacation. I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great classic for the price</td><td>For a first time reading of this classic I recommend this. If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf. This is a nice quality book though. The printing isn't too small, and neither is the book. It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like it.And as for the story, I could go on many pages. Just do a few searches for reviews, it's a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture, past and future.One of the best Classics, great one to get started on or to read over and over again.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Missing Custom House</td><td>My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We \"looked inside this book\" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Incredibly engrossing</td><td>I absolutely loved this book, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions, it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive. A flawless book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Characterization in The Scarlet Letter</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story. However, the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne's descriptions. The story takes place in 17th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced. A young woman, Hester, has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery. Now that the baby is 3 months old, they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town. Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships, revenge, immense guilt, and sin. This story is a historical fiction told 200 years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society. The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>the illiteracy of our generation</td><td>Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarlet Letter e-Book</td><td>Great book, had seen the movie but the book is much more. It will hold your attention and is an easy read too.Even better, the e-book was free on Amazon!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I just don't get it.</td><td>I am an avid reader. I have read many so called \"classics\". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say \"I have not read the Scarlet Letter.\" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>favorite classic</td><td>loved it in high school, love it as an adult...Great book and very informative.Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer.Characters and other plot.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Childish Novel</td><td>It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics. This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance. The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments. The contrasting of light and dark, with shadows, light and color is overdone and quite childish. Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness. More over, there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point, with no real conclusion. At the end of the novel, all I had was a headache, and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Jeff the Scorned</td><td>I hated this story. It was long. It was preachy. It was boring. Unless you're interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism, avoid this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ugh.</td><td>I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word \"ugh\" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through \"dost thou\" after \"dost thou\" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book \"The Classics Reclassified\".</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book was dumb</td><td>I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it, but I just did not like it. Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good, it doesn't help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Avg. Rating too high</td><td>I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Received a different book</td><td>I ordered a specific ISBN No. and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No.The picture seen online is not the one that I received.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Oh my...</td><td>This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, \"Baby daddies,\" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Far too little crime and fist fights</td><td>So I heard about this from a friend at Comi-Con. He did not know much about it, but heard some people talking about it in the food court. I thought it sounded awesome, like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader. So I order what I thought was the graphic novel, turns out it is more \"novel\" and less \"graphic\". It was nothing like I expected, and unless shame is a super power (which is unlikely) Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed!Seriously, I don't think \"BANG!\" \"POW!\" or \"ZORT!\" show up anywhere in the book! I almost gave this one star, but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name. His physiognomy is dead on as well, like in all comics, it let's us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all. Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets 2 stars.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Get to the point already</td><td>Too long. Re-read this and remembered how much Hawthorne's style irritates me. There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Slow moving predictable story</td><td>The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good book if you look into it.</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this \"perfect\" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her \"lover's\" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great!!!!!READ ME READ ME READ ME!!!</td><td>Call me a sucker for classics, well I am. This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today. Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Horrific forced reading</td><td>I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other \"classic\" stories that could be included in the curriculum.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop!</td><td>I have yet to actually complete this novel. It is so dog-gone hard to understand. On top of this, I have an essay that is due: TOMORROW! Is there no relief?!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I don't get it.</td><td>I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school (22 years ago). I couldn't get through it; the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test. I found it turgid and laborious reading.I graduated in the top 10% of my high school class. I have a master's degree. Despite my academic success, I don't understand why this book is a classic. I don't understand why Hester didn't just pack up Pearl and her stuff, move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow. That would have saved everyone alot of grief, especially young readers like me.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I hate this book.</td><td>This is the worst book I have ever read. The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period. I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>its as if I were reading the book itself.</td><td>I got the auido book cuz I didn't have time to read the book for my english report and exam. I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam. I did better listen than reading.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Way too boring for me</td><td>My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class. I consider this cruel and unusual punishment. I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about 300 pages. Its the reason why kids these days hate reading, because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter. The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead. In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life. Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death. Now I know there wasn't much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn't think it was this bad. He drags on a plot that shouldn't of lasted more than 30 pages into a whole freakin novel! Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Great plot, horrible writing!!!!!!!!</td><td>I believe that the plot of \"The Scarlet Letter\" could have been wonderful & something I would love to read, because the events are all such interesting ideas. I just think that Mr. Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style. Sometimes it just dragged on forever & I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue---I couldn't enjoy a book like that. I think if this was written by a different author, with mainly the same plot, it could be wonderful. But this, was terribly boring!!!!!!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>get it away</td><td>I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read! But this book, it does have it's interesting points but I just don't get into it. I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class. What did I have to do to deserve this? I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other, I ended up reading Chapter 9 about 10 times because the information wasn't getting to me. And the way the author addresses the reader, I want to scream. I'm sure in the 1850's this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then, but more than 100 years afterwards, people seem to lose interest. And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide. STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK! DON'T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Overrated Pretentious Trash</td><td>This novel is widely regarded as overrated. The plot is not that interesting, the writing style is torturous,the plot twists are predictable. It's a typical example of pre-20th century bad writing. Not to say that any book from that era is crap, but this book certainly is.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarlet Letter</td><td>One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature, The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today. Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed, the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society. It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear, how to think, and whom to love. The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature, hypocrisy, and of undeniable passions.Enlightening and refreshing, the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately, beyond the limits that society sets. A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages, The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A classic novel with a contemporary message</td><td>Hawthorne's masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed. It's message is subtle, yet pervasive: that people we punish as \"sinners\" are often far more noble than their punishers. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Best (or worst) of all, the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life. Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter 'A' on his chest for the rest of his term.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Each read is like peeling layers of a rose</td><td>What greater journey than to delve into the human heart? Every emotion one can nurture there is here, bared and examined.Hester, at once forthright and complex, serves as our guide, as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart.That we can fall, sin, disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A better read as an adult -- not a great choice for teenagers...</td><td>Well-paced, surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used. I hadn't read it in 30 years, and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager. There must be a lesson in there somewhere...\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't pay for this on the Kindle</td><td>Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Strong Woman</td><td>200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Slow, Overwritten Drama</td><td>It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Great Story ... Bad writing</td><td>So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful, wonderful</td><td>Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Awful</td><td>I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word \"Classic\" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was \"meaty\" (whatever that is), \"deep\", and \"powerful\"; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So boring</td><td>I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The okay book</td><td>Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I HATE THIS BOOK</td><td>I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Don't READ THIS BOOK!!</td><td>THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If your looking to fall asleep than this is perfect 4 you !</td><td>Well, im 15 years old and my english teacher assigned this book for the class. I read only 6 of the chapters and then gave up . Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it - but it has nothing to do with modern life.And to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless. Like I really care about what happenes to Hester. I've failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same. Its one of those books where you read 4 pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today. Then i have to read the pages all over again. The book is extremely boring !! - I do not recommend it!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>slowly falling asleep</td><td>The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>one of the worst books I've ever read</td><td>typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for \"fun\", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I only gave it a star because I had to.</td><td>This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>paralyzing fear</td><td>The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's \"work\". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A sin to humanity</td><td>No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is \"ignominiously\" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now...</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>forced to read the most horrible book ever</td><td>where to bloody begin.... ah.. in my junior year i and everyone else in class was forced to read the book and watch the horrible origanal slow and boring movie. after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck, right at the same time. both this and the great gatsby sucked. but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is a wast of good paper</td><td>Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another \"Classic\").</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>scarlet letter</td><td>this novel is of course set in england in the eighteeth centuryher a young woman jailed for crimes she commted outside themarriage was branded with a scarlett letter over her bossom.this was tipical of the ear and time.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Looooooooooooooooong.</td><td>If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unable to Review</td><td>Unfortunately, I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order. I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school. (Report is due Oct 25) and to date, October 9, I have NOT RECEIVED it yet. When I contacted the vendor to report last week, I basically received a \"sorry for your luck, but once it leaves our hands, we really don't care\" type of response. Totally not impressed.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Painful</td><td>This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand!</td><td>This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Save Yourself</td><td>I agree 100% that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer. But this book was horrible. A simple phrase of action (Hester walking down the street) would be 4 pages of reflection. I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck, J.D Salinger, Mark Twian. I hated this book. It was took long and nearly impossible to read. If you have to read it for school, good luck. Otherwise, avoid this. There are much better classics than this.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ick.</td><td>Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>confusing, but good</td><td>Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>SAD</td><td>this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed. not only was this a time of \"witchcraft\" and witchunts, but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery. as if it weren't punishment enough for hester to have to wear the \"a\" on her chest, everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society. i think this is overly harsh, yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well. i would recommend it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill!</td><td>This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>great!</td><td>I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time, this book required my full attention.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Beautifully Done</td><td>The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not What it is Made Out to be...</td><td>It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>hate this new format</td><td>I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wonderful</td><td>Once you get past the language barrier, this book is an amazing read. To see the tragedies that some women went through at one point in history is a great thing, and to remind us never to let history repeat itself.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Need a dictionary!</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England</td><td>Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Leave this one to the bibliophiles</td><td>Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. \"The Scarlet Letter\" is a \"classical\" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a \"Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy\". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read \"Huck Finn\" by Twain.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yes, I was another victim who had to read this for school</td><td>Ok, when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic! (I still can't) After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars. Also, it is one of the better books that I had to read for school. I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more. I still wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>a book value</td><td>The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America ; and at a bargian price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....</td><td>Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ..... . . . . .. . . .</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not interesting at all</td><td>I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is incredibly boring!</td><td>This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Both forward and backward in its ideas</td><td>First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered \"a classic,\" such as Tolstoy's \"Anna Karenina,\" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him</td><td>Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not Worth Reading</td><td>Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Power to women</td><td>I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>it was very slow.</td><td>Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century, however, this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter. The descriptions get very long, boring and tedious. As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you can't remember what happened for chapters at a time. The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It wasn't good</td><td>I starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my 11th grade English GT class's summer homework. I read and read, and I just started hearing names of people who, didn't make sense. I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is, or that other guy they talk about, I just went a long skimming the book, not able to feel any plot whatesoever! I was completely bored with this book. I didn't need a dictionary whatsoever either, but I will probably need Cliff Notes, so I could understand what the story is about, if anyone can help, please do.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ugh</td><td>Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools? Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that's fantastic. But for most kids, give them something they'll enjoy reading and maybe they'll learn to love literature more. Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A classic...but one of the worst books, ever.</td><td>At some point in your life you may have to read this snooze fest, and I pity the day you are required to read it. Hawthorne takes days to make a point, any statement at all, starting from the unbearable introduction \"The custom house\" through the last page. There is no action, no humor, no joy, only the character study of the puritan society, and a \"brave\" woman. Do yourself a favor and get the cliffnotes or use Antistudy.com. Anyone who truly believes this is a good is either a pseudo-intellectual, or they enjoy the same style of Melville, or anything written by Hawthorne. I would give this no stars if possible.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring?</td><td>Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>unfinishable</td><td>A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>American classic my ...</td><td>This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference).</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hawthorne's Masterpiece</td><td>Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love, adultery, and sadness. Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of \"The Custom House,\" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Useful for AP Lit</td><td>I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Timeless Classic</td><td>I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter \"A\" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as \"Angel\" instead of \"Adulterer.\"This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the Greatest Books Ever Written</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Does not have true plumeria scent</td><td>I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other \"Plumeria\" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Just as described</td><td>This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The ultimate for women</td><td>My wife has several workout books but as she states, \"not one matches Arnold's\". This book not only covers subjects like what to eat, it also goes into great detail on what workouts work what muscles. Great book!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Boring</td><td>I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Sorry, you won't get results like that. This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Dual Language- Selections from Don Quixote</td><td>I have found that this is an excellent tool for vocabulary building. I am able to understand the meaning immediatly and hope to continue buying dual language books for this reason.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Best one in Tomato Trilogy</td><td>Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen \"Rock\" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Pretty Fricken Sweet</td><td>You know the movies, and if you're looking at this page, you probably love them. The bottom line is, you get 6 classic campy DVDs, in their own cases, for a good price. Some of these DVDs are hard to find on their own - I personally had been looking for Return to Horror High for quite some time, before I decided to get this set. It's well worth the money - you won't be disappointed.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>FT rules</td><td>Talk about a hokey plot and cheezy acting -- this movie is GREAT !! The 1980's will never be forgotten as a decade of some really sad movies. My God does George Clooney look young and with that mop of hair..... Can't wait to see The Killer Tomatoes take France.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>100 times better than the first</td><td>This is the best movie since Monsturds no wait this movie is better than Monsturds even. You will not find a much better than this film. The first film wasn't even close to as good as this 5 stars way up for an excellent come back!!!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too Stupid</td><td>I bought this for my grandson who loves \"cheesy\" movies but even he said this movie was too stupid. The first Killer Tomatoes movie at least had some funny parts. This movie doesn't. Don't waste your money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DECEPTION!</td><td>Warning -- the two songs listed as \"Little Steve\" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Warning: You are not downloading Little Steven</td><td>I tried to download \"Forever\" by Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul, and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version. It's not the .99 cents that was stolen from me that I am worried about. It's a local bar band cheating people by listing the original artist as the performer when they know perfectly well they've never been in a studio with Little Steven.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Warming Dishs Sooooo Helpful</td><td>The Sassy Baby warming dishes are great! Add the hot water let it sit while you get baby ready to eat and away you go. Also keeps the food warm while baby is eating. The bright colors also hold the babys attention. We bought two one for home and one for grandmas house.Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not what we expected</td><td>The suction on this dish does not really work. The only thing I could get it to suction to was glass. we never really wanted it for the warming part, just for the suction. All in in all, we were not very satisfied with this purchase.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not user friendly</td><td>The dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not worth it</td><td>We tried this dish a couple of times. It didn't warm the foods that much more than just putting warm food on a plate & feeding it to your hungry baby. Just another (unnecessary) step in the feeding progress. Don't waste your time.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great warming dish</td><td>I love this dish. I try to keep from microwaving my baby's food, so I put really hot water in the base of this bowl. It warms my baby's food (even food from the fridge) and keeps it warm. As another reviewer said, the dish is very difficult to separate.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NOT USER FREINDLY</td><td>This product is a good idea however:1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.2. Can't be put in the Micro.3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open).5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointed</td><td>Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not User Friendly. NOTHING that says it's BPA-free</td><td>Nearly impossible to disassemble for cleaning.Hole for water is tiny.Bottom gets very hot to handle, food takes awhile to warm up, then remains warm for only about 20 minutes.MOST importantly, IS THIS DISH BPA-FREE OR NOT? I've seen it listed on BPA-free lists on the web, BUT, there is nothing on the package or product description that deems it so.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sassy Baby Warming Dish vs. Gerber Bowl</td><td>Keeps food warm. Sticks to the tray of the high chair. Gerber bowl doesn't stick. The little dividers are nice for serving. The only complaint is that it is very difficult to get the divided bowl off the bottom.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>just what i was looking for</td><td>i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Must-Have for Children's Library</td><td>I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very informative</td><td>I just returned from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, and I found this book extremely useful for Cambodia. Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap. The Vietnam portion was helpful as well, but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country. I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition, which is *really* outdated.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>...</td><td>I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any use</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1996 edition of book is outdated</td><td>The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Disappointing</td><td>This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Arrived broken!</td><td>Well, this is one of those \"you get what you pay for\" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>complicated</td><td>I still haven't figured out how to put this light together. When I do, the wires appear very delicate and I doubt it will even work. The directions are atrocious. But at least it doesn't require batteries, so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>junk</td><td>this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>entertaining, but not for everybody</td><td>Although, in a certain sense I did not like this movie - one thing that I did find that I did like was that it was entertaining. It's a daring movie that take a rare look at what we've been missing in today's corperate -hectic (kiss butt) culture. And that is emotional honesty. It's like a release, a drug, or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are, and not necessarily how we act in everyday life. We definately need more movies like this (despite what some critics may say).</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Adam Sandler lame as ever...</td><td>I was told that this was a decent movie.But I didn't care for it. I find Adam Sandler as funny as Jerry Lewis, not very...The animation was pretty good however.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>One of the worst I have ever seen</td><td>Do not buy or rent this. Adam Sandler is officially a no talent hack. This is not for children or anyone for that matter unless lame brained scattological humor with absolutely no point is your thing.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Nauseating!</td><td>If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Spare yourself.</td><td>This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it, but there are always exceptions.If you're looking for a sweet Christmas tale, watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. If you're looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a \"moral\" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it. There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there, but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Adam Sandler's eight crazy nights</td><td>I thought this was a big dissapointment! It is crude beyond \"good taste.\" I wish I could return the DVD but I don't have my receipt so I'll just \"trash it!\"</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A very disappointing movie</td><td>Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>8 Crazy Nights</td><td>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! One reviewer states, \"the funniest Christmas movie ever\". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Clean it up!</td><td>The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>1 star, since there's no \"zero stars\" available</td><td>I can't believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes. How in the world did anyone watch this for 30 minutes? So I only watched 10 minutes, but a movie that starts the way this one does is not getting any more of my time. My hairdresser highly recommended this, and all I have to say to her is, don't give up your day job to become a movie critic! Total garbage.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Eight Crazy Nights</td><td>I couldn't tell you how this movie ends, we turned it off after the first half-hour. Not appropriate for children, not entertaing for adults. Our dog even left the room. Don't waste your money.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie</td><td>Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>sandler is da bomb</td><td>8 crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious. Adam Sandler was good and should be seen by families.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler</td><td>Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>i want my money back</td><td>Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>terrible movie</td><td>I used to be a fan of The Simpsons, but now much more of a South Park kinda guy, so it's near impossible to offend me really.. The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it). Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating, but that's Sandler's great gold.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie!</td><td>This movie was terrible!\"WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!\"Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The worst movie ever made</td><td>Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this. And if you do, BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>ive seen this before...........</td><td>this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums, actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy.

I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Awesome</td><td>I have been a huge Adam Sandler fan for years. I love this movie it makes me laugh so hard. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the same old same old holiday movies. Two thumbs up:))</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hilarious</td><td>I loved this movie. It was hilarious and Sandler's fans especially will be cracking themselves up. I must admit that it is very crude at parts, so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters, it probably isn't suitable for the young ones. Although, I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads.The message is good and the overall story has a message. I cried for Whitey, and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch. But it is HILARIOUS, from the triple breasted lady, to Whitey and his sister, to the deer (who's significance I really didn't understand).A must see for anyone <over 13> with a good (but stupid) sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Adam Sandler is Awesome</td><td>This movie is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better. The special features are the shiznit.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Crazy about 8 Crazy Nights!</td><td>This movie is awesome. It is the perfect movie for the holiday season. I am absolutely crazy about Whitey, the old man referee in the movie. Elenore and Davey are also hilarious! I love this movie and watch it over and over again with my whole family. Something you should buy because it is great!\"Smell you later poopsicles!\" (A funny line from the best movie in the WORLD!!!)</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children.</td><td>I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from \"Billy Madison\" to \"Punch-Drunk Love\". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for \"Eight Crazy Nights\". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Nightmare Before Hannukah</td><td>I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this \"feature\" to anyone. \"Eight Crazy Nights\" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch \"Ishtar,\" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.</td><td>Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages</td><td>I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>To be honest....</td><td>To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Sucks</td><td>Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>return to forever proto-type</td><td>Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever, so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album. I always loved Corea with Farrell, because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe's flutes, sax, etc., like rain drops or storming. Nice soprano. And ELVIN JONES! I put this up up around the \"Joe Farrell Quartet\" album, and Buster William's bass is great, so much I don't miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland. A fresh sound, unparreled even now. It makes me want to see the Outback movie. The album cover is beautiful. Finally, the price is outstanding. Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Inappropriate for young children</td><td>In two of the episodes, the word \"shut up\" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DVD Features</td><td>Percy And The DragonOut in Augest06Storyteller: George CarlinStories stops:*Percy and the dragon*Donald and Doglass*The Deputation*Time For Trouble*A Scarf For Percy*The Dieasel*Edward's ExpliotsDVD Features:*DVD Game*Sing Along*Web Fun*charater GalleryAND MoreALSO Look For The Upcoming DVDsThomas Gets Tricked DVDBetter late than Never DVDOn Site With Thomas DVDANDCome Rides The Rails DVDAND DON\"T FORGETThomas halloween adventure DVDTO BE COUNTINUED....</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My little Thomas fan loves this DVD!</td><td>My little Thomas fan loves any of the Thomas DVD's, no matter how many times he watches them.

They hold up well even with every day wear, got a year+ out of the last pair. he also says they are very comfortable.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Why so expensive??!</td><td>Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Spun Out</td><td>The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged \"Adam And Evil\"); (2) Deborah Walley's \"girl drummer\" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues \"I'll Be Back\". Everything else is redundant.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs...</td><td>Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with \"...lots and lots of girls.\" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Who else would have three beautiful women after him?</td><td>\"Spinout\" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In \"Spinout\" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on \"The Donna Reed Show\". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Presley's Worst Film</td><td>\"Spinout\" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as \"I'll Be Back\" and \"Stop, Look and Listen.\" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The music's better than the movie</td><td>SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include \"Stop, Look, and Listen\" and \"I'll Be Back\".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY</td><td>This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have \"JUST SAID NO\"!!!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Spinout</td><td>My husband and I love auto racing of all kinds. My husband loved this movie. I'm writing this review for him, as I'm not much of an Elvis Presley fan.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Piece of junk!</td><td>This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Works and is easy to use</td><td>You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water, as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line. The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle. After a few minutes, you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card, which gives you your nitrite level. It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Buy!</td><td>This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an \"assembly required\" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included, so don't buy an extra chair separately!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Desk!</td><td>This is the best kids' desk you will find for the money. I can almost guarantee that! It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly. The wood is solid, not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>good quality for price</td><td>This desk is really pretty. It is a good size, but not overly big in the room. I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase, and not to order the chair separately. I also ordered the matching 3-shelf bookcase, which is a slightly different shade of white, but nothing too noticeable--especially since they aren't by each other. We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but still wants something that looks nice.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great desk and a great buy! Thanks Amazon:)</td><td>We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework. It was not to disappoint. The desk is perfect size for her to sit and work. Very high quality and easy to put together. I would highly recommend this product to others?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love KidKraft</td><td>I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great Value for Less Money</td><td>I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be \"normal\" desk height for later years, making is a \"Teen\"kraft desk ;-). Thanks.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>very nice</td><td>This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very Satisfied</td><td>I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great value for good quality product</td><td>Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If it's good enough for Popeye...</td><td>I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A Must Have for ALL Aspects of Love Devotees!</td><td>Being a huge Aspects of Love fan, I was extremely excited to find another cast recording. I was sceptical however, after reading reviews for this recording. After listening to it, all of my fears were put aside. This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director. I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung. Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent. A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Cheap and dangerous</td><td>Though I've had this only about a month, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Do NOT buy.Other better brands include Unicorn (recommended by a famous cooking magazine), Peugeot, Firth, and William Bounds.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Skip it - buy the full sized version</td><td>This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Slow</td><td>I bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Multilevel marketing meets education</td><td>I had to purchase this book for a community college class I'm taking. As a \"textbook,\" it has been a complete disappointment. The \"science\" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like \"you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education\" (straight from page 8!). Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from. The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch. In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting \"certified\" in Mr. Jensen's unique, \"empirically unproven\" techniques.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Well-Researched, easy to read, practical</td><td>Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more! He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read. I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it, too, for the students' sake!</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>\"Pop\" psychology at its worse...</td><td>...Mr. Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops, seminars, presentations, publications, certifications -- if you've got the money then they have something to sell you...and all of it is centered around what is termed \"brain-based learning\"...but what this book presents is little more than 400 pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations...for example, it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and, hence, classrooms should be painted yellow...however, he doesn't offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up...it's all just ridiculous...how does this stuff ever make it into print?</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Get off the dead horse of \"old school\" education</td><td>To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so \"no child is left behind\" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a \"fad\", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of \"accountability\" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in \"leveling the field\" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of \"survivalists of poverty\". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to \"get off the dead horse\" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Easy read for brain information</td><td>This book was purchased for a PhD level course. It is a very easy read. It gives practical applications to the latest brain research. On a down note, there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study, but he does give an extensive bibliography. This book can be used for parents to read about how their child's brain works, or for teachers within a school system. It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Fuzzy around the edges</td><td>I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:\"Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain\" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Brain Based Learning: The New Paradigm of Teaching</td><td>I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book. The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room. Unfortunately, there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book. As this is a text book, it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken. This is really unacceptable for a text book. It is one thing if it were a literature book, and even then, it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book. If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version, I would NOT have purchased it. I would have purchased a used hard copy.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Brain based Learning</td><td>This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Pop psychology at its worst</td><td>I find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff. He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of mid-air, supposedly based on the brain research. If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this, read it carefully. He jumps to conclusions with little to no evidence to back it up. Plus, he is neither a teacher nor a neurologist. He just found something he can write about and sound like an expert. Plus the writing seems written for, we'll, let's say, young readers. Very simplistic, which is not always bad, but in this case, it is.Again, read carefully. Analyze his statements and look for the actual scientific proof for them. You will be hard-pressed to find any, either in his book or elsewhere. Total fluff.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>\"Science\"</td><td>\"On average, we breathe through one nostril for about three hours until the tissue becomes slightly engorged; then we switch to the other side. The nostril we breathe through affects which brain hemisphere we use.\" (p25)\"[T]he female brain processes both language and feeling at the same time far more efficiently than the male brain does.\" (p20)These two quotes should tell you what you need to know about the quality of the \"science\" contained in this book.Lord, if this is what we teach our teachers...</td></tr></tbody></table>Showing the first 1000 rows.</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["original_test_df = pd.read_csv('amazon_review_polarity_csv/test.csv', header=None, names=('label', 'headline', 'review'))\ntemp_df = original_test_df.copy()\noriginal_test_df['label'] = temp_df['label'].apply(lambda x: x-1)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"56725bb1-7d74-4360-925f-0d97161baa07"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Developement Mode\noriginal_test_df = original_test_df.iloc[0:20, :]"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"f1383189-c289-4624-9d4f-f047b016ea25"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["raw_test_df = spark.createDataFrame(original_test_df[['label', 'headline', 'review']])\n#temp_df = raw_test_df.copy()\nraw_test_df = raw_test_df.na.drop(subset=[\"headline\"])\n \n#raw_test_df['label'] = temp_df['label'].apply(transform)\n#raw_test_df = spark.createDataFrame(raw_test_df[['review', 'label']])"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"57277a51-1961-4ade-a560-415dd7ecc82f"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["display(raw_test_df)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7b3da7c6-06f4-451d-a213-a3f71154ac71"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"overflow":false,"datasetInfos":[],"data":[[1,"Great CD","My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation.

I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting.

I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing \"Who was that singing ?\"</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play</td><td>Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Batteries died within a year ...</td><td>I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>works fine, but Maha Energy is better</td><td>Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great for the non-audiophile</td><td>Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DVD Player crapped out after one year</td><td>I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Incorrect Disc</td><td>I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DVD menu select problems</td><td>I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play.

going to buy any cd for this much money  this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny  The best soundtrack ever to anything "],[1,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time  hands down  The intense sadness of  Prisoners of Fate   which means all the more if you ve played the game  and the hope in  A Distant Promise  and  Girl who Stole the Star  have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years  The higher energy tracks like  Chrono Cross   Time s Scar     Time of the Dreamwatch   and  Chronomantique   indefinably remeniscent of Chrono

one I assure you you will not forget  It has everything for every listener    from fast paced and energetic  Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home   to slower and more haunting  Dragon God   to purely beautifully composed  Time s Scar   to even some fantastic vocals  Radical Dreamers  This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there  and surely Mitsuda s best ever      an absolute

review  But it wasn t as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on  If you don t like your killer to be supernatural then don t bother with this  Its about a guy that comes back from the dead  His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place  The acting wasn t bad at all  and neither were the deaths  In fact it was kinda gory  But that doesn t make a great movie  The flashbacks were a little confusing as well  I wouldn t watch it again  But its far from the worst movie I ve seen  It was  ok  but I won t watch it again"],[1,"I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti  who I m in love with  was one of the leads   and I really didn t expect much from what looks to be a low budget indie horror flick  But  I really did like it  The lead girl who plays Jennifer  Nikki DeLoach  is really good  I can t believe I ve never seen her in anything before  Maybe I have  but I didn t know    It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie s  Terry Kiser    he is a really good actor  Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in  lol  Anyways  this was a cool movie and I m glad I got it  Loved it   P S  Stephen Colletti is so hot  "],[1,"It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming mask maker"],[1,"I liked the film it has

tree roots in the yard  Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what  It was not on a tree root    NOT the worst American B Movie"],[0,"MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion  A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty  Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy MASK MAKER isn t the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn t tread new waters either  The cast performs on various levels of competence  WEEKEND AT BERNIE s Terry Kiser is an effective guilt ridden buffoon  Treat Williams is ill used in a cameo role  Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role  Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role  giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female  Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti  sic  is equally flaccid An open ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II   something we definitely don t need  MASK OF FAMILIARITY"],[0,"Sadly  there is absolutely nothing original in this movie  The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone  turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers  I couldn t find a thing that elevated this movie above a     other like films  The plot is standard  a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history  A standard  run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it s too late  Everything happens exactly on cue  in order  with no surprises  and no frights  This movie is safe and boring  it really couldn t have been any better if it tried  Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman  playing a nice guy for a change  can help the dullness of the script Even the title is a misnomer  Although the original title  Maskerade  isn t any better And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres  Unmasked                  "],[1,"This book was in my library s Genealogy section  and you re not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library  But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it  in two sittings This a quick read  because it has loads of pictures  photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants  and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards  work certificates  yellow stars  etc  It s more like a museum exhibit than a simple book  Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too  although it is clearly written for adults  Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno Kaunas ghetto all in one place Both researchers and the ordinary

only ten  which is a typical Thomas DVD  However  between each story  it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas  As I parent  I m not interested in this  and I know that my   year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day  Plus  the sing along section has one song  One  We have other Thomas videos that has at least    and they aren t

impression this book is supposedto leave on children  This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale  when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin  The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig s big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy  This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers  I can see how this book might be

the book to be light hearted  fun and relatively fast moving  True  it was predictable  but that didn t detract from Capella s take on the triad of Bruno  Laura and Tomasso  In fact  it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story  The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere  though at times were a  trifle overdone   pun intended   The only thing that kept me from giving this a   was the author s descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic    too male  perhaps  like reading Playboy Penthouse letters    for my taste  In all  though  the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons  Delicious reading"],[1,"THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing  From page one I felt like I was in Italy  smelling the smells  seeing the sights and above all  tasting the food This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory  who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight

possible to discover some of the dishes described What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food  this does for Italian  There is magic in preparing food for those you love  This is a fable  a romance  in the medieval sense of the word   It s about the magic and wonder of food and love  the sensual beauty of the world  Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy"],[1,"This book is better than

food  cooking  markets and people were fun  Didn t mind the creative cursing   how very true to  Roman young stud  it was  Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped  but I much prefered to read about Bruno I liked this book SO MUCH more than  Cooking for Mr  Latte    it was a fun read  Cameriere "],[1,"I didn t like the ending  the characterization leave something to be desired  and the

searched everywhere for the book here in the states  and it was sold out everywhere   and to be honest  I am not sure why  All of the characters were not very well depicted  except for Laura  The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid  And the plot very predictible  The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out   there was no need for it in the book  I just can t seem to think of anything really good to say about this book   maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook  Not very good    "],[0,"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read I wish I had saved my money and my time The book is full of superlatives  Everything is  the best ever experienced  again and again The characters NEVER become embraceable  One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk  The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware  but is really just stupid  Her friend is promiscuous  which is all we ever really get to know of her The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader  But  the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader  Very inappropriate Not sure who would really like this book Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot  story development  characterization or any other facets of literature Find yourself something with a little more substance  and I think you ll be much happier  Do not waste your time    lousy"],[0,"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love It s a lot better when it deals with food than with love  In fact  food is not only a metaphor for love and love making but seems a more than adequate substitute  People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot  openly cribbed from Cyrano de

with him  This film was well done  It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage  One thing that stood out to me  which bothered me  was that the  in laws  of Rani s character

the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face I d give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only   stars for the DVD quality  It s definitely pixilated in parts

marketing problem  Or  maybe just lazy writing  Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian  Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama  Starts out with promise  but then goes downhill "],[0,"Wow  I usually like Adam Sandler   Judd Apatow Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it  I don t think I laughed once during the entire movie  Not even a chuckle  It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film  The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow s ensemble doesn t seem to work with Sandler s schtick  I loved  Knocked Up  and     Year Old Virgin  but there doesn t seem to bee much chemistry with this group  I was waiting for  Bruno  to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation  I almost bought this  I m so glad I only rented it  Not so Funny people "],[0,"An acceptable movie  with some good moments by Adam Sandler  and some of the other new American comedy guys  but very far from his really  funny people  involved movies  like  ANGER MANAGEMENT   with Jack Nicholson  or the hilarious  LITTLE NICKY   Obviously  not Adam Sandler s best"],[0,"I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie  They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up  When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it  My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it  I don t watch a lot of TV  but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while If you re into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight  then you re going to like this film  However  if you re looking for humour like Adam Sandler s previous films  i e  Happy Gilmore  etc  then you can forget about it I give this film   star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film     Not what I expected   "],[0,"Not much to say about this movie   i am a huge Adam Sandler fan  and i love him in anything    but this movie was looooong and booooring    The comedy

am getting alzheimers Finally we figured it out  we started to watch this movie together about   months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies  but this one really eats the bird skip it            worst film ever"],[0,"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny  This however  just  well  wasn t  I really do believe that this movie had potential  but there was so much going on  so many stories within the story  that they could have made   movies out of it It s   and a half hours long  That s about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot  This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic  or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out There is very little humor in Funny People  The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there  which is probably why  in my opinion at least  that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn t go straight to DVD  The L O N G E S T movie    EVER "],[0,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate   trailer trash movie like this but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them  this movie is as funny as a sewer  all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity virtually ever second word  the writer who has very little  if not any intelligents  has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly   yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity  however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing  if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you  profanity the movie    or profanity and the degenerates    "],[0,"A truly great example   of how terrible some movies have become   Vulgar   Offensive  Unnessisary nudity   I usually love Adam Sandler   and can t believe he d stoop so low in this role  Seth is highly likeable in this   but still swears and lowers himself as well  The woman who plays Adams  romantic interest  is mostly great   but also stoops to swearing   blantant sexuality  The writing is the worst in this movie  This awful movie is   hours and    minutes long   but only feels like   hours    And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow  I suggest skipping this movie altogether   Tragic where movies have gone to  Much has been lost  Scott MacNeil   comedian  Seth Kept this movie from getting a  ZERO  star rating  "],[0,"Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of

the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early   th Century  It s a love story  Very funny and endearing  And the hero is a cat  This is a must for Joann Sfar fans  Sfar s Best "],[1,"This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi s husband  I was not disappointed  I think everyone will love this illustrated novel Jorma The Rabbi s Cat is the cat s meow "],[1,"The Rabbi s Cat is a wonderful book  I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book  The book is in the form of a comic strip  each box lovingly illustrated by the author  The pictures are wonderful  particularly of the cat  They are a joy to behold Even better are the stories  anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties  The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny  The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches  Through the difficult medium of comics  the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place  Much of the book is given to musings about life  philosophy  love  God and so on  If you like a good discussion  you ll enjoy this book Although the books can be enjoyed by non Jews  I think if you don t know the basics of Judaism  you ll be missing the most vital part of the book  Of course  the book is so appropriate for the cat lover  The author clearly understands cats perfectly  A wonderful  funny sad book"],[1,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won t repeat it  However  I will emphasize what was not commented on  The Author is a very talented artist  He takes risks on many pages and it works  resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text  The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying  I hope there is a book to follow  I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs  good artwork too "],[1," The Rabbi s Cat   by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar  is a whimsical  charming fable featuring a rabbi  his lovely daughter  and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat  Both protagonist and narrator  the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments  often sardonically  on the actions of the humans around him  Set in pre World War II Algeria  with a lengthy detour to Paris  the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural  social and religious backgrounds  In this multilayered environment  the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place  Delightful  exotic world seen through a cat s eyes"],[0,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi  his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her  The tale seems promising at first  until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws  The cat represents the glorification of sin itself  and delights whenever the book s characters fall into ungodly habits  judging them forever as hypocrites  taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin   As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God  At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi  thus giving the tale a  happy ending   In short   The Rabbi s Cat  is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists  atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self serving  do as you feel  lifestyles One more note  This book  despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover  is definitely not appropriate for children  Self Serving Message"],[0,"As someone who is interested in different cultures  I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people s thoughts  Instead  I open it to find a swearing cat  he uses the F word  denigrating religion

adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either  I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book  Not what it looks like on the cover "],[1,"The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill s side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms  Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the

suspicious of the novel s factual integrity when I read that a murderer s eyes are  as pale blue as a malamute s   when in fact  according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America   a malamute s eyes

not a strong enough villain to carry this book  He is not scary or very threatening  It s not exiting  Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta s  Even if Cornwell did

myopic  focussing only on one group of people for a moment  He shows how government intervention  well intentioned as it might be  always hurt people in general over the long term including the people

planning to do either  because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice Unfortunately  there are some erroneous ideas in this book  Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy  he also seems to think that capitalism s merit lies in its service to the  common good

the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships  what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those

negative side is that I m rather short  These are more of a one size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I m       Not an issue  it s meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants  but I m already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans  Not the best for sitting  whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn t do that  The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised  Long torso but great product"],[1,"I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all  I do suggest finding your correct size  not the size you think you are  The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape  It flattens your middle so your blouses  tshirts and dresses look much nicer  Love This Item"],[1,"I received my Squeem   month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back  This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL  Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw   tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half way covering my butt   hips  EUREKA   What a difference this made now i m loving it and hardly leave home without it  I originally bought the XL nude now i m getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L  Great product  my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer  Had some problems at first but now i love it"],[1,"I have the nude version of this chincher in small I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus  I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive  This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation  I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists The length is fine on me  going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones  I am  ft   The cinching effect takes about         inches off my waist comfortably  enough to get into my vintage dior I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss   but I think I will give it a try  Good choice for getting a vintage look"],[1,"I am pleased with this item  It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso  but everyone is different of course I wear it a lot and it has held up well  It is rubbery  so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires  Squeem works well"],[0,"I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size   when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small         AND THERE IS NO REFUND     So I didn t wear it or use it    and I am out        plus    for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for    one I could wear and use   will not buy from this seller again Too small   NO RETURNS"],[1,"this product does exactly what it says it does  the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on  the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier   Don t give up it is worth it  wow"],[1,"I enjoyed this waist cincher  it corrects my posture  and makes me look slimmer However  I think it stretched out a bit    Or I lost some inches  Great "],[0,"I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big  The item is also like it is made from rubber  but because I needed it for this weekend I don t know what I am going to do at this point  Wasn t what I expected"],[1,"provides great support and slims me down by   inches when I wear it  I ordered a size small   The size chart is very accurate  it fits like a glove  great"],[1,"I do believe this product is very good but  in my case  the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything  I am already petite  so the cincher doesn t significantly reduce my waistline  It does  however  make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour glass like  You cannot really wear it under thin clothing  as others have pointed out  and  for me  it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days   the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation   but I still recommend the product  It is a very good and very cool cincher  I think it can even be worn on top of clothing  for a goth or fetish look  It is well made and makes clothes look better on you  a good smoother"],[1,"I bought this item for my wedding dress  I wanted to make sure that I  tried out  the cincher before my big day and it works really well  I started out with this same item  in a Small   but it gave me  back fat  which I do not normally have   I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm  When wearing the cincher you have two  size options  with the double hook closure  which allows you to let it out more around the bust   tighter around your  natural  waist to create a better shape  It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material def makes you sweaty   but it DOESNT move around  Totally worth it Kinda painful   the boning pushes into my  under side boob  probably because I am not super skinny immediately

this kind of product  I ve had   babies so far and haven t found a product like this  I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette  but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up  I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts  but I ve had it for a week already  I ordered all    black   beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps and I ve already got used to wearing it everyday  it s pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look  I love it  now I m just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist  I ve read that it can last up to over a year  so deffinitly worth the money  Would recommend this to everyone  squeem cincher"],[0,"I wore this for my wedding since I hadn t lost all of my pregnancy weight  It was great for a little bit  But then started getting a crease around my waist  I can t wear it anymore  Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours

wanted    I look a whole size smaller  instantly  I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love  but they were asking almost      for it  I highly recommend this item and the seller  Great product  great seller "],[0,"I think the concept is great but with this particular product  they have these sections that are thicker rubber  or whatever the material is  and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down  I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day  It would ve been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren t very flexible  Painful Experience"],[1,"Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture  It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down  I ve been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone  Of course  you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money  Great Product "],[0,"After trying three different sizes I still couldn t find one that fit  I first ordered a medium and it wouldn t even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big  my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge  wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it  The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced     there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper  poor fit"],[0,"When I received this  not only was it way too small for me  the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging  It was unbearable  sort of like a burnt rubber smell  There s no way I would recommend this to anyone  There are definitely other products on the market that do the job   Not recommended "],[0,"The product did what it was  supposed to  which was to give me a waist  but it kind of just redistributed my fat  My waist was super tiny  but above and below  mostly below  I bulged like crazy  so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned  My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod  so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be    I guess this product worked for other ladies  but for me  it just looked really unnatural and odd  Gave me a waist  but just pushed my fat around"],[0,"Please note that I ordered three of these items as

effects   Wore it to work for   hours  took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color  i m black  and had lines  which turned to bruises  on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting    I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline  so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable  That experience did  however  give me more incentive to exercise and

would give it   stars    Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles"],[0,"I ve been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years  I purchased a new one recently and it s not the same type of

years of switching from cincher to cincher  found the right one  It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to  right sized  eating  whereas a lot of times I would get seconds  I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving   which of course is wonderful  I didn t mind that sometimes it bunched up  I didn t mind that sometimes it left welts  that went away shortly after I removed the cincher   however  after about two weeks  on of the metal prongs came out  making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn t hold it s form  Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held

uncomfortable after a while  I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind  The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little  Should you buy it  If you are tolerant of the ins and outs  then go for it  It was inexpensive  A bit uncomfortable   "],[1,"I m fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me  with no problem  I love that you can t see

making a change that is a big difference for me  I would recommed others to buy it  really love it "],[1,"All and all this is a very nice product  It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing  It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours  The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture although not totally  away from your skin  Now mind you it is pure rubber  yes I said rubber  so make sure you wash it thoroughly  also it will take two days to air dry I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon      much cheaper than a boutique Cher  Wow "],[0,"I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions  trying a large  medium and small as my size changed after having twins  Unfortunately  I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on  I don t know why I kept trying aside from desperation  It just gave me a very weird shape  Sure  it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top  I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my  excess  down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse  I m giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it s just my body type that is the problem  I have a long torso at      and    lbs  Great

a bit more comfortable for that  These things are really great  I can t believe I didn t know about them after my first   c sections  They should send all women home with them after giving birth

what is the sizing "],[0,"This corset makes me Sweat like a hog  I am not I m a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach  Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape  was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it  because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable  hot and sweaty underneath  This was bad for my skin too  it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods  It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I d want to take it off immediately  so I never wore it  and just gave up and returned it  Still looking for a perfect corset  this however is NOT it  Don t waste your time  Causes sweat that makes it

was great  just as advertised  helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist  I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture  too  although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space  However  I put it on today  and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in  the support thing  bone or whatever  under

 after having my second child  I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it  I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being

sweat  It speeds up the weight loss process  I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank  I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it  All in all it s a great product and the most comfortable cincher I ve ever bought  Love this "],[0,"I purchased this item to wear postpartum  I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby  The major downside to this is the poor quality  The eye portion of about five of the hook eye closures has come out entirely  I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it s only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest  Very disappointing for

full the rest of the day  It recommends to wear it about   hours but I can even sleep with it  the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks  it gives me a smaller waist than what

this as it is its purpose  I did like the fact that it s shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy    BUTTT    a HUGE BUT for me    What I didn t like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back  eewww      and I don t even have back fat    So to me this defeats the whole purpose  All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat    Also  what s going on with the

mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support  It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before  a great buy "],[0,"I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it      But this waist cincher is not for me  I m not gonna say don t buy it because alot of women are shaped different I just got it yesterday and I m sending it back  It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all  So if you know you have more than enough back fat  this is not for you  I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help  I wear a size medium  so its my correct size  But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me  The vest covers all the back fat and everything  But I still give Squeem thumbs up though        No No No This is not for me     "],[1,"I recently purchased the Power Cotton   Rubber Waist Cincher  and loved it so much I thought I d give this one a try as well  As far as the smell  it s very faint  Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly  The fit was nice   comfortable  But it s not a solid black like you d assume  Prepare for a charcoal black gray color for the exterior  The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies  so get ready to have a sticky

the medium fits perfect on the first loops  Just take your measurements before you order  Hopefully  as I lose weight  from my running training program  I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a

have this pooch in the front that I didn t have before  It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front  I think I would rather have the love handles  I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts   Not exactly why I bought it but o well   I still gave it   stars because it is still working for me  just not how I thought it would  Not for everyone"],[1,"I first ordered size X L  but that was too big  so I returned it and bought a L  The first couple of wearings were difficult  but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body  I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it  sort of like the top part of panty hose   I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around  It is not comfortable to wear while sitting  For me  I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter  as I think my torso is shorter than most  I do think it is helping  but I need to wear it for more hours  I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep  rather than in the daytime  but I have not tried that yet  The product is well made  Squeem   A Combination of Scream and Squeeze

the seams through your clothes  It is hard to bend over  especially as a school teacher  I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke s Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear  Hard to put on"],[0,"This product sucks It doesn t completely suck    the   days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight  As many people have noted  it is HELL to get into this the first time I liked that this wasn t a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up BUTThis garment    Rides up  if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist   Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist   and it hurts   Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down  visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice  first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side  ouch    RETURNING THIS    Why does everybody rave when    "],[0,"It was really easy to put the Squeem on  but once it was on I couldn t wait to get it off   It wasn t too tight or anything  The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip mid back area and pinched my skin  It was so painful  No matter how I positioned it  it would bunch up  Really disappointed since it was a waste of       Uncomfortable "],[0,"This shape wear is the best I ve had until now regarding easiness to wear and put on  It does a great job at keeping the post pregnancy flabby belly under control  However  after about   months of daily use  the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric  It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out  I wish there was a better designed support for this binder  Otherwise  it is awesome   good looking for such lingerie  So  if you buy it  expect   months of wearing it without problems    Great idea  poor design"],[1,"it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought   for friends loveit best shapewear"],[0,"I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to

waist and give you a nice looking figure  Well  it did hug my waist  but it also gave my a muffin top  Not a shape a woman wants to have  I looked better without wearing it  It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body  I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts   no hips  or ass  Not for a woman who has large breast  hips  and ass  Not for women who are going through post pregnancy either  For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself  it failed  Not OK   "],[0,"Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job

expecting a miracle  After only wearing this twice  it is stretched out  At first  I thought perhaps it would regain it s shape after a few hours but nope  It s no better than a cheap  fashion corset  It will smooth things out so there s less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real  waist trainer   something that would go on tight and STAY tight  Considering I found this product when

rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices  I notice  I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it  but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin Otherwise  the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time  Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes    Wow  Ow and What s that smell "],[1,"i have a       inch waist

that snug fit   it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long  I really do like this item  the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your

their customer service is worse than useless  I d owned mine for about   weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched  The threads aren t frayed  they re unstitching from the seam Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility  They ve asked for pictures of the damage  and then failed to respond to the pictures  or any further attempts to contact them For what this costs  it needs to last longer than   weeks  Poor quality and lousy customer service"],[0,"Hello  I am a woman nearing my   s  and my waist certainly isn t getting any smaller  I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever growing belly  To accommodate for my girth  I bought the Squeem  Magical  Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX Large  the largest size available  WELL  here s a bit of magic for ya  sisters  The second I snapped the first two hooks together  the tightness was unbearable  It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass  Fortunately  the discomfort didn t last long  since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether  These things need to come in larger sizes  Not even worthy of   star  More worthy of steaming diarrhea  IN THE TRASH IT GOES     "],[1,"This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have  The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new  It must be washed before wearing  The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat  But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening  The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it s good for the back as well as the front  Very sturdy"],[0,"I liked how it pulled everything in  I felt fantastic for about   hours  it really flattens the tummy area  which is all I really want  but you can see the hooks threw clothes    I

that is too big now and I may need to buy a small  I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore

used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at   months post partum  It s still a bit separated but this definitely helped  I wish I knew about it sooner  It also helps support the back when

was uncomfortable and totally noticeable  even without a super tight or thin shirt on   especially when I sat down  The seams and the boning are all very noticeable  and the rubber makes clothes catch

from Crate and Barrell  They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways  First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark  Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them  After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them  They also seemed to chip very easily  So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn t take looking at them anymore  They also are not good in the microwave  They get very hot and the food not so much  I would not recommend for everyday use  Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable  My advice is to purchase

Jack Higgins has written many fine action packed books  However  this book reads like a twelve year old wrote it  The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts The author and his publishing

disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself Yet  once I overcame my frustration and finished the book  I regretted not heeding to my senses It s obvious that Mr  Higgins had no heart in writing this book  and he made no effort in showing creativity with words I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases  e g

has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice  He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary  He pickup a couple of his terrorism criminal partners making killing like a habits  terrorism competition  fun game and egoism fulfillment  It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity  The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence  This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value  I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion s serial after finishing this ridicules book  Actually  this book is not worth one star "],[0,"It s a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters   Sean Dillon and his     in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians

people speak  Then the characters overexplain because  apparently  the author wasn t paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago Frankly  I ve read enough about the

simplistic"],[0,"This is simply the worst book I remember reading  I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels  so I happily picked this up  I m sorry I did  It is nothing but action  which might be

for many years  and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written  Some were great and full of suspense  But the last three he has written  including this one   Edge of Danger   are very disappointing  He has resorted to producing   books a year  based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth  predictable characters  and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer Count the number of Marlboros smoked  the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank   and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another   and you find a shallow book  I would save my money on this one  and buy it only if you collect Higgins First

this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story   or like the outline of a book  It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue   no conversation was stretched into

Kate   It s the Hazar Scouts    Puhleeze  Not even an exclamation mark  Many other examples could be given  Now  assuming for the moment that the dialog was  say  written at greater than a  th grade level  the plot is almost as bad  The protagonists  reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one by one is almost comic  There s no depth here  just one simple vignette after another  I wouldn t

Good story  Poor writing"],[0,"I ve never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger  I ve enjoyed Mr  Higgins  books in the past but can t for the life of me understand a  why he wrote this book  or b  why it was published  There is no plot  no character development  predictable action  no tension  It s like reading an Executive Summary of a book  Are you sure they didn t publish the outline by mistake  Do I have to give it   star "],[0,"I m so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel  If it were  it would also be my last Normally  I can forgive Higgins his cliche s and his obsessive attention to his characters  drinking habits  because his characters are fun and interesting  He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them  and you can t wait to find the next book especially if it s got Sean Dillon But not this one  All the characters are wooden  The action is colorless and completely unbelievable  A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog  A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else There is no sense of timing or place  only the thinnest of motivations for most characters  and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters This book is amateur hour  Don t bother  Read some of Higgins s earlier works instead  Disappointment on every page"],[0,"Boy  this was a disappointing read  The characters were not well developed  hence challenging to keep track of   the plot was implausible yet predictable  and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book  I did  although it was unrewarding to do so I d rate this lower if I could FYI  if you re looking for an alternate selection in the same genre  I highly recommend Silent Joe by T  Jefferson Parker  I would rather watch paint dry"],[0,"Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons  fine dining  glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development  Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers  And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another    sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes    strains credulity Higgins has done some first rate work  Had this been published twenty five years ago  this might have made a difference  It wasn t and it doesn t  Tired formula"],[0,"This is by far his worst effort that I ve read  He s not my favorite spy author anyway  This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher s contract or obligation that Mr  Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a

enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books  although they have tended to become more samey  I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger  The tired old characters of Dillon  Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable  highly contrived and unbelievable yarn  The plots have all been used before  and if you ve read any two other Dillon books you ll be able to guess the next line throughout  I bought it to read on the plane   was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding  Give this one a miss  Completely predictable"],[0,"This book has no plot  and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing  Sean Dillon s character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening  A very poorly written book  The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it  Mr  Higgins  it s time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than   weeks on writing a book   EXTREMELY SHALLOW"],[0,"I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently  but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further  His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible  pointless heritage  But  what do you expect from a middle aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket     depth  Cartoon Arab Scottish Villain"],[0,"Given the lack of character development  or rather  simplistic and at times contradictory character development  the lack of any plot whatsoever  and poor visualizations  I can t believe I read the whole book  I guess I kept waiting for the action to start  It never

 This book reads like a  th grade reading level condensation of an outline of a screenplay  The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long  very few words greater than two syllables are used  No complex thoughts  no character development  no suspense  and little description  Pure formulaic twaddle  I d rate it   stars if I could have   "],[0,"The plot is not believable  there is not a shred of character development  and there isn t even any descriptive atmosphere  It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel  I shall not buy any more of his efforts  A bad book  poorly written "],[0,"This is without a doubt Higgins  least inspired work in years  The plot is predictable and over worn  and the books is very uninspired  A real disappointment higgins disappoints"],[0,"The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor s deadline  There was no character development  Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense  I ve never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again  Poorly Written"],[0,"It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger  The writing is just plain shallow  the plot predictable  Save your money for something better  A Disappointment"],[0,"This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last  Especially if  as the reviews state  it is the best Higgins book in a long time The characters are never developed  The way the book begins  you think that the Rashid s are the good guys  and Dillin is the bad guy  Then all the sudden  without developing the characters  the roles are switched  You end up not caring who dies  and   billion people die in this book   a little overkill  and who lives The  adventures  are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are  They are very predictable  and of course  Dillin is killing    people and no one can kill him  Just ridiculous scenes Don t get this book  despite the  reliablity  of the author  Horrible"],[0,"Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on going saga of Dillon  Ferguson and Bernstein  If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins  then you might like Edge of Danger  because it is more of the same   However  if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins  efforts  then you probably want to take a pass on this  and for me at least  future efforts as well   Higgins  books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels  Dialog between the characters  which often is terse  choppy  and unimaginative  makes up virtually all of the text  Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text  As with the last few books from Higgins  Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment  Not worth the effort"],[0,"A terrible  childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature  Higgins loves to  speak Irish  but even that gambit fails in this trite  poorly plotted  worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can t do any better than such trashy writing  Can t believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book"],[0,"I purchased this book expecting very good things  I found the plot very thin and predictable  There was very little suspense  It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out  Also there didn t seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded  and on the surface stupid  behaviour  Disappointing and thin"],[0,"I don t know who is worse  Higgins or Macnee  The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next  Completely implausible  Macnee s narration is so overdone it is laughable  Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts

that are completely wrong is another thing  For an example I have these questions Q  How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody  the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance A  I don t know if the mob knows it but at least four times Q  Why the target man  who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him A  Because the target man likes to be in danger Q  When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn t he A  Because something in his head didn t let him even if

delving into the inner parts of the human soul  This book does much more than that  It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy  He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly  He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture  He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who

Classics  Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom   Hawthorne creates an ok tale  but really  It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic  Then he throws Pearl in there  she is like some super human and belongs in fantasy  I never really did believe in the whole  they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything   That is just a bit hypocritical  either she was excepted as prat of the society  which she was not  or she wasn t  which she almost was  See that just doesn t make any sense

that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral  or pink  than scarlet or red  Also  the back cover is white  and I am most definitely one for appearances  I would have like a slightly

wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic  The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his her sins  and how honesty  for some  comes at the price of great shame The novel does take

must own for anybody that values the concept of reading  And if you didn t like it the first time  read it again and give it a second chance  I ve read it about six times and it gets better each time

Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times  Scarlet Letter review"],[1,"Hawthorne s best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns  Still  many of the book s allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers  The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition  Excellent romance in an excellent edition"],[1,"I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it  I would definatly recommend this to other readers  The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature"],[0,"Hawthorne s dull prose really gets to you after a while  The book is filled with antiquated language  and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery  I was forced to read this book for my English class  and it was a terrible waste of time

in minutes  ZzZzZzZzZzZz      Terrible book  do not read it "],[0,"I stongly dislike this book  There is too much meaninglessness to it  I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph   it s awful  Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary  I have understood two chapters  I don t see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences  It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering  As I stated before  this is not my kind of book  Meaningless Drivel"],[0,"It is my invariably correct opinion that the so called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed  with EXTREME prejudice  for crimes against humanity

english  which adds to the difficulty  and even if you can understand it  you finish the book and say   Ok  so what s the point   There is absolutely no point to this novel  Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text  and the description is so vague that you can t even tell what a character is doing half the time  Who Chooses Classics "],[0,"This novel was the most boring book I have ever read  I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance  Even though there is much

I really appreciated it a lot  a must read"],[1,"Any Hawthorne work  including this one  shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature  As to subject matter  kids are more receptive to the likes of  The House of the Seven Gables   Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn t been forcefed  The Scarlet Letter   complete with the Customs House filler  in high school

would never read on my own  I am a    year old and I enjoy reading  But this book  while it does have a few good points and messages  is incredibly dull  The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class  While this book has a rather good story it s concealed by endless symbols and references  I suggest the cliff notes version   Boring"],[0,"This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow  Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn t understand them until they were pointed out to me  If you don t get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don t read it  There is a lot of symbolism in this book  too  Really Hard to Follow"],[1,"Of course this is a classic of American literature  and  to my mind  with good reason  The story engages and puts one in the time  It requires a modern reader to stretch  but the exercise rewards  A fascinating look into another time s mores"],[0,"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call  Old English   use the much cliched Olde if you must  to  New English   And trust me  it shows  Virtually every book ever written during this period   essentially  before Twain s Huckleberry Finn   bears the same markings   incredibly lavish diction  complex structure and syntax  and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel  If you elevate your reading to that next level  where you re seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne s masterful use of symbolism and metaphor  and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late     s  then you ll consider this book a worthwhile

rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book  I really feel like I don t have any right to complain since the book was free but  you get what you pay for The book starts with an

may want a nicer version for the bookshelf  This is a nice quality book though  The printing isn t too small  and neither is the book  It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others

is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive  A flawless book  Incredibly engrossing"],[0,"The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story  However  the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne s descriptions  The story takes place in   th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced  A young woman  Hester  has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery  Now that the baby is   months old  they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town  Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships  revenge  immense guilt  and sin  This story is a historical fiction told     years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society  The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story  Characterization in The Scarlet Letter"],[1,"Frankly  in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us  It seems too  that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading  Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written  What I always find fascinating is that this  like most other classics  is about human nature  power and the consequences of actions  So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others  to be voyeurs which is what makes a classic a classic  the illiteracy of our generation"],[1,"Great book  had seen the movie but the book is much

boring and pointless novels in existance  The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments  The contrasting of light and dark  with shadows  light and color is overdone and quite childish  Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness  More over  there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point  with no real conclusion  At the end of the novel  all I had was a headache  and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times  Childish Novel"],[0,"I hated this story  It was long  It was preachy  It was boring  Unless you re interested in catching up on battles

the   th century  and that s where it belongs  It wouldn t be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book  but reading through  dost thou  after  dost thou  isn t any fun However  I highly recommend reading Richard Armour s take on SL in his book  The Classics Reclassified   Ugh "],[0,"I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it  but I

was dumb"],[0,"I ve bought this book  underlined every hint of symbolism  found all evidence of romanticism  followed every quote involving thematic oppositions  and noted every example of Pearl s

where it belongs  at zero  Where to begin    perhaps with the run on sentences  the failure to create significant rising action  the flat two dimensional characters    This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader  but frustrate them as well The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant  Post modern society does not really care about   Baby daddies   and the revelation which is made at the end  and beginning  of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury  Unfortunately  Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster  Oh my   "],[0,"So I heard about this from a friend at Comi Con  He did not know much about it  but heard some people talking about it in the food court  I thought it sounded awesome  like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader  So I order what I thought was the graphic novel  turns out it is more  novel  and less  graphic   It was nothing like I expected  and unless shame is a super power  which is unlikely  Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed Seriously  I don t think  BANG    POW   or  ZORT   show up anywhere in the book  I almost gave this one star  but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name  His physiognomy is dead on as well  like in all comics  it let s us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all  Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets   stars  Far too little crime and fist fights"],[0,"Too long  Re read this and remembered how much Hawthorne s style irritates me  There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it  Get to the point already"],[0,"The story is a very simple one but the action  so to speak  doesn t really happen until the final third of the book  It was a battle to get through the dry middle Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least On the plus side  the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres  Slow moving predictable story"],[1,"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it  It is true that it s language can be hard to read and understand at times  but that does not make it uninteresting  The main story  may not be considered exciting  but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book  Several faults are pointed to in this  perfect  Puritain town in which the story takes place  The book uses good elements like foreshadowing  foil characters  and a lot symbolism  A main point of the book is Hester s admiting her guilt as compared to her  lover s  hiding his guilt  I m not going to tell you who she had the affair with  but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter  The book may not be as exciting as some  but don t let this keep you from reading it  because it really is good  Good book if you look into it "],[1,"Call me a sucker for classics  well I am  This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today  Yes  the book was written over     years ago  but it deals with Single mothers in a two parent society and how the outsiders to the situation  townspeople  deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter  Pearl  Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings  even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child ren  and to survive themselves  Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers  but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book  I give it five stars because of it s beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single parenthood  Great     READ ME READ ME READ ME

reading I graduated in the top     of my high school class  I have a master s degree  Despite my academic success  I don t understand why this book is a classic  I don t understand why Hester didn t just pack up Pearl and her stuff  move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow  That would have saved everyone alot of grief  especially young readers like me  I don t get it "],[0,"This is the worst book I have ever read  The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period  I hurled it across the room at one point

and did great on the final exam  I did better listen than reading  its as if I were reading the book itself "],[0,"My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class  I consider this cruel and unusual punishment  I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about     pages  Its the reason why kids these days hate reading  because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter  The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead  In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life  Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death  Now I know there wasn t much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn t think it was this bad  He drags on a plot that shouldn t of lasted more than    pages into a whole freakin novel  Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible

interesting ideas  I just think that Mr  Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style  Sometimes it just dragged on forever   I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue   I couldn t enjoy a book like that  I think if this was written by a different author  with mainly the same plot  it could be wonderful  But this  was terribly boring         Great plot

in the other  I ended up reading Chapter   about    times because the information wasn t getting to me  And the way the author addresses the reader  I want to scream  I m sure in the      s this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then  but more than     years afterwards  people seem to lose interest  And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain

Trash"],[1,"One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature  The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne  tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today  Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed  the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society  It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear  how to think  and whom to love  The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature  hypocrisy  and of undeniable passions Enlightening and refreshing  the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately  beyond the limits that society sets  A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages  The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time  The Scarlet Letter"],[1,"Hawthorne s masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed  It s message is subtle  yet pervasive  that people we punish as  sinners  are often far more noble than their punishers  Judge not  lest ye be judged

Then we read it in our academic English class    th graders  and I was absolutely astonished   Not only by the magnificence of the book  its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching  but by the ignorance of some of my peers  It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it  Please  please  read this book  You will not be sorry  I promise  Wonderful  wonderful"],[0,"I ll admit right up front that I am stupid  I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing  endless prose that Hawthorne uses  I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale  A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood    It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word  Classic  stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it  Yes  it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism  and it was  meaty   whatever that is    deep   and  powerful   but it was dry  slow  and boring  Even someone as myself  who generally enjoys the classics  will fall asleep  as I did everytime I tried to read

do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society  If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev  Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller  I think this book should be only read voluntarily  If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider  The okay book"],[0,"I m sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much

introduces some advanced ideas for the times  such as writing about a single mother  as well as musings about women s rights  His obsession with Victorian themes  such as the deification of children  fixation on bodily sins  as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader  While this book could probably be considered  a classic   such

be challenging to read  but I liked the story  Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion  which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective Although I did not

tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period  When we do something wrong  the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character  One event does not define us  It s our entire lives that should be taken into account  I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne s point  Redemption is possible for anyone  regardless of their sin  Also  the father who

the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them  someone could always count on the nature s love  It s very beautifully written  The story of adultery and

moral  movie  please beware  it is far  far  from it  There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there  but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness  Spare yourself "],[0,"I thought this was

me want to celebrate Chanukah There are only two real redeeming features of the movie  These are the little old man Whitey  because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like

all wanted our money back  The movie is not funny at all  Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy  there are alot of sad parts in it  but they label it as a comedy  All this movie

annoying and pointless  The emotion and general plot was pretty good  and I ve always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work  but this movie was bad  some of the singing was okay  but personally I didn t like half of it   Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating  but that s Sandler s great gold  terrible movie"],[0,"This movie was terrible  WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE  Well it starts out with Davey  a drunk who is crude and mean  Then when he gets into trouble he s doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney   No offence to little people out there  that it not my intention to offend anyone   Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack  and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn t any better Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney  That is until his place burns up  So he moves in with Whitney and his sister  and they set some ground rules  Then as the movie goes on  they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion  and when he cries it s all the sudden a big deal  And for some reason the deer in the woods talk  and help Whitney out  What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus I hate the music in it  the voices are annoying  and the characters are mostly unlikable  So warning to parents  keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie  Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie "],[0,"Yeah  it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids  but it isn t It s mean spirited movie that goes nowhere  It s crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler  but not even in a funny way  Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port a potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh tsicle   then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh t stuck in their teeth  Yup  that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein Please don t buy this  And if you do  BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it  The worst movie

this movie  It was hilarious and Sandler s fans especially will be cracking themselves up  I must admit that it is very crude at parts  so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters  it probably isn t suitable for the young ones  Although  I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads The message is good and the overall story has a message  I cried for Whitey  and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch  But it is HILARIOUS  from the triple breasted lady  to Whitey and his sister  to the deer  who s significance I really didn t understand  A must see for anyone  over     with a good  but stupid  sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs  Hilarious"],[1,"This movie is great  but having it on   disc

enjoyed him in everything from  Billy Madison  to  Punch Drunk Love   So with that in mind  I had high hopes for  Eight Crazy Nights   To say it was a let down would be an understatement  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey  He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle  Sandler s Davey Stone character is so annoying  you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first    minutes  If you don t  you ll be treated to jokes about hairy butts  a woman with three breasts  a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces  Sounds appealing  doesn t it I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny  but I don t  Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last  Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children "],[0,"I love Adam Sandler  Well  I used to love him  before he made Eight Crazy Nights  Not only was this cartoon not funny  it was downright trash  I would not recommend this  feature  to anyone   Eight Crazy Nights  was short on story  long on time  and wearing on patience  I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself  I needed some justification for wasting the   hours of my life that I will never get back  Needless to say  I stuck it out until the credits  and now I have to live with the facts that I      watched the movie  and     I ll never get that time back  So now I sit here  typing away a review I doubt anyone will read  wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie  HUMBUG  Watch  Ishtar   you ll get

I enjoy Adam Sandler movies  I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore  Sure  they re not great films  but they ve given me plenty of laughs  So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful

could go on about the awful story  the grating voices  the cliches and schmaltz  or the bad songs   Yes  Virginia  this is a musical  The worst musical ever unleashed on film  No  I haven t seen every

another Adam Sandler film  Worse Movie I ve Seen In Ages"],[0,"To be      honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so

terrible  Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible  I mean this is a stupid movie  one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him  It s almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more  The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler s character but once again it fails  we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge  This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film  And one last comment  Why the hell is this a double disc DVD  All of Sandlers good and or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment  This movie sucks  Sucks"],[1,"Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever  so you can imagine a strong

She looks like she s out to prove she can really score  and I never saw parts move like that before  Elvis looks embarrassed  Anyway  after you ve crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want

you ll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom  Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles  Also  the man who plays Shelley Fabares  father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on  The Donna Reed Show   So  try to not to knock this movie  It s got great songs and the title tune was a top    hit by just that much  So  treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can t understand why Elvis wants to stay single  Who else would have three beautiful women after him "],[0," Spinout         represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema   a bad sitcom without the

vid  game music  I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music  It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras  It would impress anyone who cares to listen      Stuning even for the non gamer</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best  game soundtrack  and I figured that I d write a review to disagree a bit  This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda s ultimate masterpiece  The music is timeless and I m been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say  but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money  this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny  The best soundtrack ever to anything </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time  hands down  The intense sadness of  Prisoners of Fate   which means all the more if you ve played the game  and the hope in  A Distant Promise  and  Girl who Stole the Star  have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years  The higher energy tracks like  Chrono Cross   Time s Scar     Time of the Dreamwatch   and  Chronomantique   indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger  are all absolutely superb as well This soundtrack is amazing music  probably the best of this composer s work  I haven t heard the Xenogears soundtrack  so I can t say for sure   and even if you ve never played the game  it would be worth twice the price to buy it I wish I could give it   stars  Amazing </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music  I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it s truly relaxing and peaceful On disk one  my favorites are Scars Of Time  Between Life and Death  Forest Of Illusion  Fortress of Ancient Dragons  Lost Fragment  and Drowned Valley Disk Two  The Draggons  Galdorb   Home  Chronomantique  Prisoners of Fate  Gale  and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three  The best of the three  Garden Of God  Chronopolis  Fates  Jellyfish sea  Burning Orphange  Dragon s Prayer  Tower Of Stars  Dragon God  and Radical Dreamers   Unstealable Jewel Overall  this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music Xander Cross Excellent Soundtrack</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If you ve played the game  you know how divine the music is  Every single song tells a story of the game  it s that good  The greatest songs are without a doubt  Chrono Cross  Time s Scar  Magical Dreamers  The Wind  The Stars  and the Sea and Radical Dreamers  Unstolen Jewel   Translation varies  This music is perfect if you ask me  the best it can be  Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper  Remember  Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once  and heard at least a few of the tracks here  And whether you were aware of it or not  Mitsuda s music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game Composed of   CDs and quite a few songs  I haven t an exact count   all of which are heart rendering and impressively remarkable  this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget  It has everything for every listener    from fast paced and energetic  Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home   to slower and more haunting  Dragon God   to purely beautifully composed  Time s Scar   to even some fantastic vocals  Radical Dreamers  This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there  and surely Mitsuda s best ever      an absolute masterpiece</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is a self published book  and if you want to know why  read a few paragraphs  Those   star reviews must have been written by Ms  Haddon s family and friends  or perhaps  by herself  I can t imagine anyone reading the whole thing  I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another  It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a  worst book  contest  I can t believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing  Maybe I can offer them my  th grade term paper on  To Kill a Mockingbird   a book I am quite sure Ms  Haddon never heard of  Anyway  unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke   stay far  far away from this one  Buyer beware</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I loved Whisper of the wicked saints  The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book  I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels  but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it  I loved it    This is a brilliant story because it is so true  This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it  It is not a typical romance  it is so much more  Not reading this book is a crime  becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story  Glorious story</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints  I fell in love with the caracters  I expected an average romance read  but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time  Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked   The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia s did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader  If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read  Don t let the cover fool you this book is spectacular  A FIVE STAR BOOK</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on  not easy to put down It left me wanting to read the follow on  which I hope is coming soon  I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it  This book made me want to read again  Very enjoyable  Whispers of the Wicked Saints</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A complete waste of time  Typographical errors  poor grammar  and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing  I m embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book  The Worst </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was a great book I just could not put it down and could not read it fast enough  Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next  This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up it can also make you so angery  this book can make you go throu several of your emotions  This is a quick read romance  It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night  Great book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I thought this book was brilliant  but yet realistic  It showed me that to error is human  I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him  I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down  I also loved The glass castle  Great Read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one  and not a very discerning one  All others beware  It is absolute drivel  I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover  but the first page of the book removed all doubt  Wait   maybe I m missing the point  A quick re read of the beginning now makes it clear  This has to be an intentional churning of over heated prose for satiric purposes  Phew  so glad I didn t waste        after all  Oh please</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money  This book seems to have been written by a  th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age  As another reviewer points out  there is a misspelling on the cover  and I believe there is at least one per chapter  For example  it was mentioned twice that she had a  lean  on her house  I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot  that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling  Please don t waste your money  I too  believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author s relatives  I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on  Awful beyond belief </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It s glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person  perhaps the author herself  They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book  Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author  Don t try to fool us with fake reviews </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>When you hear folks say that they don t make  em like that anymore  they might be talking about  BY THE SEA   This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man  three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort s owner  As is often the case she  finds  herself through honest  often comical but always emotional  interaction with this sizzling roster of players  With the perfect mix of special effects  that salsa sound and flashbacks  BY THE SEA  gets   BIG stars from me  A romantic zen baseball comedy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings  I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings  Then I found Jobst UltraSheer  They gave me the compression I needed          but looked like regular pantyhose  Even though my blood clot has been gone for   years  I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice   Note  I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh  I tried the Jobst adhesive  but I hated having my skin pulled all day  I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling  Fashionable Compression Stockings </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Excellent product  However  they are very difficult to get on for older people  I feel like I ve had a full day workout after getting them on  Also  as the day wears on  they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin  I have to wear them  so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help  Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart  I tried to put it and sheer it   I guess you should not buy this item in the internet  it is better to go to the store and check it sizes recomended in the size chart are not real</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This model may be ok for sedentary types  but I m active and get around alot in my job   consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles  Not Good   Solution  go with the standard compression stocking         stock          Excellent support  stays up and gives me what I need  Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time  Good riddance bad investment  mens ultrasheer</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix  I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies  But no  it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix  If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise  Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy  it is extremely sticky   However  with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients  I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy   Also  this mix has really large chocolate chips in it  I love that I removed a star for the addition of  natural flavors  in the mix  Delicious cookie mix</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Rather than scratches and insect droppings  this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution  Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer If you ve ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy  you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white  The surrounding countryside and  old home  scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright  clear  and immediate Here everything is dull  dark  and clouded  Or  if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain s commands  so are the visuals After that  it is hard to believe this award winning  critically acclaimed film s best presentation is on YOUTUBE  Somewhere  out there  is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a   mm public library reel Just none of them appear to be on Amazon  Another Abysmal Digital Copy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters  I don t know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents  age old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community  and their peers  adulation of Western culture  True to form  the  New Young  of Japan seem to be creating an  international  blend  as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family  Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author  adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens  and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out  A great read  A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I heard a song or two and thought same o same o but when i listened to songs like  blue angel   lanna  and  mama  the hair just rose off my neck Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don t find much now days  i liked this album more then i thought i would</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I have had the charger for more than two years  It charges AA batteries just fine  but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries  To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end  In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up  and now three out of the four won t hold  The problem is the flip mechanism became loose  and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up  What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon  apply the crayon on the buttons  and wrap the tape around  You know how painful that is  Problem with charging smaller AAAs</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought one of these chargers  the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges   true  The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done  Which is also true     hours of charging and the lights stay on  I returned it thinking I had a bad unit The new one did the same thing  I just kept it since it does charge   but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on  It s a  backup  charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn t want this as my only charger  Works  but not as advertised</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I read the reviews made my purchase and was very disappointed  The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time  I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries  Disappointed</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism  but this volume did not live up to the expectations One essay  among other things  describes the veil as potentially liberating  It doesn t begin to explain how or why Another  on Muslim women in Cape Town  claims that Muslim women there are separate but  more than equal   Gee whiz  what a disappointment I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid  But there is not a single one in the book I m surprised it didn t have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation   Alyssa A  Lappen Oh dear</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This VCR DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet  Based on the reviews and price  and because I own a JVC TV  this was my choice  I agree with the easy set up  It s a bit awkward to work the whole TV VHS DVD selection options but I think I ve gotten the hang of it Two comments  it s not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated  too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically minded than me  so I ve had to rely heavily on the how to manual  And setting the VCR timer is awkward    you can t enter the start and end time but have to scroll  unless I m missing something    but those are my only complaints  This is a good product for your      Based on the reviews here I bought one and I m glad I did </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am a big JVC fan  but I do not like this model  I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store  I bought one anyway  new  and must say I am not happy  The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while  the transition between scenes is not always smooth  like a little pause  and while it is still fairly new I can t get any DVD CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work  All I get is a  incorrect disc  message  Incorrect disc </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m a JVC nut   I have   JVC televisions  one VCR  one bookshelf audio system and car audio system  So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be  I decided on the combo player because I don t think VHS is going to be around much longer  I like my combo player except for   things    no cable box compatability on the remote control    no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono   wife can t tell the difference in the sound so if she s happy then I ll just live with it  VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT        happy with it   but</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The plot is so ridiculous  I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film  The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer   and the cars behind don t notice  The mountain lion is captured   and put in a jail cell  Get real  Utterly  completely stupid  should be titled  Hollywood Debacle </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hotel Babylon is not just good TV   it s great TV     The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite  formerly of EastEnders  a BBC soap  and Max Beesley  from the ill fated movie  Glitter  starring Mariah Carey   The show could make for a great drama series  but I felt that it is a mix of a drama  comedy  and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show  The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn t get around to seeing it  I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great  The season finale was an interesting to watch The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from      to       The reason   Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five star hotel in England I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC  Is this great TV    You bet it is</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If you have even casually looked into applying to law school  have already read everything there is in this book

dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class  The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party  I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach  Growing up a surfer in San Diego  I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers  Honestly  when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie  The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last  vibe  Surf Cha Cha  Surfers don t CHA  Unfortunately it wasn t entertaining in the least bit </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture   This book is a lucid  well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored  and even mocked  our personal and public responsibilities  The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer s best seller  LOOKING OUT FOR     This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media  politics and discourse in general  to clear their heads for the substantial challenges

Frustrating</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This game makes you do the same things over and over  it never holds my son s attention long enough to get to the next level  There is no choice of games you

to have to do this  But after repeatedly attempting Allman s recipes and having to throw out      cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time  and then comparing to Ed Wood s recipes which work flawlessly  and Lisa Rayner s very excellent Wild Bread  Hand baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen  I can t help but notice that their recipes work  where Allman s fail I m not a novice baker  The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe  but that can be found other places as well If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it  I recommend any of Ed Wood s books  even his very old ones  Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread  But pass on this book While some of the historical vignettes were interesting  not enough so to warrant the cost of the book  Check it out at your library if you must  Cannot recommend</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska  Loved it  I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon  Book is full of great stories and recipes  Alaska sourdough</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is worth to

several  The picture quality wasn t all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away  Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote   the layout makes no sense at all  Very poor human engineering  IMO  I brought it back to the store for a refund  I saw the same model under the Emerson name for       at WM but was hesitant to buy it  Maybe I got a bad one </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Light weight  space saving very attractive design  Sharp Picture  Good sound quality and quick response time  DVD playback also excellent  Only negative is its remote control  It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices  The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use  It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil  The quality  the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy  Sylvania     LDG     Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD

channels  this TV is not going to give it to you  The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function  so I bought a Sony universal  which is a much better remote  that had the recall button on it  However  I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash back  It may not be a big deal to some  but this user found it very annoying      BEWARE    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I bought this to replace a     tube tv in my kitchen  What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space  The picture is good  and the internal DVD player is a bonus  All in all  a good purchase  Kitchen TV</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The first one I bought was defective  The DVD didn t work at all  I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful  They gave me an RMA number right away  Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived   week later  This one is just fine  I really love the clarity of the picture  My only complaint is that in DVD mode  the sound isn t loud enough  I have it in my RV and with the A C running  I can barely hear it  I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system  It s very lightweight and easy to move around and store  A bonus for the RV  The remote isn t great  but it works just fine and the video audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player  All in all  it s a great deal for the price  Nice for the money</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is  clean and proper  and fails to shed light on the rest of it  I can understand that these are  tourist guides  and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time  However  I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference  I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before  but with the precision and detail of DK s series  I was left yet again in disappointment  Disappointed Romanian </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe  The combination of good pictures  illustration and texts is perfect  You get a good overall view for the most important sights  places  cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information  As a European

top  The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material  but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom  However  since it was in another smaller box  I m thinking that the scraping was there to begin with  and not from shipping  Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage  I wouldn t want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now  Other than the damage  it s a very nice screen  Scraped across the whole top </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You don t expect music from

make this shoe anymore  so I had to order them through Amazon  Sadly  the second pair ripped in the same place within   months  My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better  Didn t live up to expectations </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The narrative style of this work by famous founders  biographer John Morse is arrogant  flippant and frequently exaggerated  It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high  passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate  Perhaps considered penetrating for its day  it really represents nothing more than opinion today  The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory  with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now  If it weren t for the fact that Morse wrote this piece     years ago  I d have rated it only one star  Profound then  Truly horrible now </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was a gift for my   yr old daughter  She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer  She is still enjoying this game  She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first  but she loves to do it over and over again  The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant  It seems to be very user friendly also    my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time  Definitely enjoyed </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie  This game is tons of fun  even for a    year old  We love playing it together  We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems  What even better is  she can play it alone and I get some me time  Even Mommy has fun with this one </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My   year old daughter has been addicted to this game  She plays it over and over again  She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop  She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan  The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can t get it out of my head  Great combination of creativity and adventure</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is such a great game both my   year old son and   year old daughter love it  I like to play to if they would let me  So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game  Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be  Great fun for all   Rapunzel</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>    My daughter and I loved the movie  She is   years old and it took her   hours to complete the game  Absolutely no challenge  and very little interaction  It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the   or   scenes it has programmed  There are no games to play  nothing to figure out  nothing to do  Save your money   Not what I expected </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My   year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers  But halfway through the game  the program hung  and wouldn t let us leave the room or click anywhere else  Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up  we are frozen in one spot while Barbie s disembodied voice urges us to  explore somewhere else in the castle  Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn t help  Vivendi Games  support site is  currently disabled   And now I m left with a weeping  frustrating child who doesn t understand that it is not her fault that her game won t work  I m hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn t catch the bug my   year old caught the first time around  Or maybe they just don t care about the problems  so long as you get our    bucks  If you don t want a crying little girl  avoid this game  barbie rapunzel   crying child</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I purchased this software for my   year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much  She lets me play it sometimes  but she doesn t always like what I come up with  I plan to purchase other software programs for her  Barbie as Rapunzel  A Creative Adventure</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My   year old daughter   I both love this software  We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room  This game allows you to be creative   use your imagination by  decorating  each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince s crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone   bring him back to life  The music   animation is the best I have seen  Most of the kids software that I ve seen is boring to me as an adult  but this is not at all  I sometimes like to play it without her  There are so many variations on color schemes   patterns   that you can never be bored  I highly recommend this for girls of all ages  Use your imagination </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind  The only bad thing is that there is only one  castle  for the kids to  decorate  and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it  You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did  My sister finished the  castle  in about   hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore  It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money  Not so good   ok for a rental </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>NEGATIVE  This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can t have it on multiple computers  It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot  this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task  You can t view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files  Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults it CRASHES all the time Mouse is jumpy and hard to use POSITIVE  Some tasks are easy  possible to use  grand and beautiful My

a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May  With no memory of the life before then  she stays with the old caretakers of the isle  After the caretakers are dead a young man  Colin Macpherson washes up on shore  Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past  They are opposites but you know what they say opposites attract  This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series  I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest  This is a great book for girls about    to    because it is still a romance novel  but not what you call a trashy romance novel  It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels  a great book for Historical romance lovers</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>When I got this book  I wasn t expecting much  but man was I wrong  I loved this book  Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt  but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander  Tess is a very soft heroine  While she sometimes seems too guillible  I have to remember that it is part of the story  This is one of my favorite books in the series  YES   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up  Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin  Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem  The plot loses much of it s believability mostly due to the poor characterization  All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason  Even Tess and Colin s development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced  The writing does improve towards the end but it s not enough to save the book  Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series  skip this one  Not the best in the series</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am disappointed in its performance  It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs  half the

encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping  However  the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances   for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn t have anybody to ask for a clue  it leaves a lot of questions unanswered   for this  however  there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks On the brighter note  I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general  I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba   you can t go wrong with it  Very authentic</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I agree  the CDs are a much needed help  since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker  However  the design of the book is really poor and confusing  I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba  And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it  This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills  Not the best</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ordered

nails  etc    and decorate the floats   all by herself  She ll get everything ready  showing me everything she has accomplished along the way  and then we ll watch her special parade  A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend She can mostly do the entire game on her own  I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game  The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game  It s tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish  It would be much easier using a regular mouse

truly are  not actual patterns  Norma Gregory s talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer This book is not for beginners   but more seasoned artisans If you are looking for patterns  like I was  you will be disappointed in this book  Not Patterns   but Detailed Sketches</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>my brother in law was thrilled

century comedies  and ruined it  The costumes are intentionally absurd  think Beach Blanket Babylon   the acting is way over the top camp  and the incidental music could not be worse  The music  BTW  is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern  anything but   th century  The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly  fusty old play I like  The School for Scandal  very much  and not having found any other DVDs of it  I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production  But when they got into the extended bop be bop of the drinking song scene  I knew I just couldn t ever sit through this one again The visuals are also blurry  but with the production being so bad  so what  Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD  As Bad a Production as Possible</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller

wave singles from the   s  these are just cover versions sung by the  Starlite Singers   The description of the record says that it is by  various artists  implying that they are by the original artists  but this is not true  Total garbage  The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it  New Wave   s</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs  Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists  In fact  it says various artists  which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs  It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is  after all  a compilation of music by various artists  Duh  So  don t waste your money  I will probably throw these in the trash as I m a purist and I want original  not wedding reception music  Don t Be Fooled </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs  These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS  If you loved K TEL CD s and don t care about hearing the artists originals  and don t care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad  then you might like this cd  But if you are a fan of the    s and the amazing music it produced  then buy other collections and don t waste your money on this schlock     Buyers Beware         </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Performance is outstanding  I had a previous Sony   mm Handycam which died and I

never really seems to get going  There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect defendant are left unasked After     pages  I realized that this book wasn t going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end As a result  the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier  Based on the ending  the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent I did enjoy parts of the book  however  and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate  not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end   I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written  Never gets going</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it  because it didn t match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak  Now I know  the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it  Later  with the help of a trusted friend  she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience  This what the second book is about  The most wonderful thing about Dorie  is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life  She is still able to have a successful and happy life  in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood  This is what so many women need to hear  With the Lord s help  it is possible  Now  The Rest of the

step away  My review is based on old memories  but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan s methane atmosphere  We ve learned much since this book was written  and Titan s atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought  However  this book was well written  and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father  who is now working at NASA on the Cassini Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan  This book has that old style sci fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy  I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov  you will enjoy  Trouble on Titan   This was an intriguing book that influenced my destiny </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>We got these as a gift for our one year old  He loves them  He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks   and obviously fails  He loves that some of them move  some of them jiggle  some of them make noise   its almost an adventure The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside  B   Banana  P   Penguin  U   Umbrella  Z   Zebra Bonus   when the   y o gets frustrated because he can t pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries  he usually flings them  The   y o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them  or dropping them off high places  And I ve stepped on two of them already  They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well  Peek a Fun

product</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters  They are just over   months old and they love them  This product is a great learning tool for them for years

FP Catalog There are little to no pizazz to the blocks  Some have features where you can  spin  them  like the letter Q   Queen  or the W  watermelon seeds that rattle    but most are just a  look at me  type of a block With that in mind   yes I like the product  They re blocks  They re meant for stacking  knocking over and banging   which my son loves  he s had these since he was   months   They re better than the plain wooden blocks because they re textured  they have objects inside  letters   lots of opportunities to learn letters  colors  objects  descriptions  etc For now he s stacking  banging and knocking over  It ll be around for a while until he s ready to learn more words  colors  objects  animals  This review isn t profound or eye openings because again   they re just blocks  Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision  It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist    They re blocks   keep that in mind</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought these for two reasons  blocks and educational letters  However  the letters are rubbing off  For the price I paid that was dissapointing  Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun  Would

cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside  They also have blunt corners  so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children  The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots  We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends  Great Blocks</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON S FAVORITE  SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD  THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING  Awesume  BEST BLOCKS EVER

sets packaged in an A to Z learning format  I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus  Definitely worth every penny  Great value </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed         They can be purchsed for about     many other places  Wonderful but not worth     </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a great set of blocks  I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable  age and developmentally appropriate  and highly educational      bucks may seem like a lot  but I think it is well worth it  I am very impressed with the quality The size and shape of the blocks is just right  My son is   months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands  PLUS  the blocks do not have sharp corners  like the wooden blocks also available on this site  that could hurt your little one  especially those of you with chewers   One category that I rated this toy with only a    instead of    is the  fun  factor  For younger babies that may not  get it  yet  this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older  My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks  but then again he is only   months  Give him a couple of months and he ll really dig them

was it as great as people are letting on  If you don t like your killer to be supernatural then don t bother with this  Its about a guy that comes back from the dead  His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place  The acting wasn t bad at all  and neither were the deaths  In fact it was kinda gory  But that doesn t make a great movie  The flashbacks were a little confusing as well  I wouldn t watch it again  But its far from the worst movie I ve seen  It was  ok  but I won t watch it again</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti  who I m in love with  was one of the leads   and I really didn t expect much from what looks to be a low budget indie horror flick  But  I really did like it  The lead girl who plays Jennifer  Nikki DeLoach  is really good  I can t believe I ve never seen her in anything before  Maybe I have  but I didn t know    It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie s  Terry

are here don t trip over the tree roots in the yard  Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what  It was not on a tree root    NOT the worst American B Movie</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion  A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty  Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy MASK MAKER isn t the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn t tread new waters either  The cast performs on various levels of competence  WEEKEND AT BERNIE s Terry Kiser is an effective guilt ridden buffoon  Treat Williams is ill used in a cameo role  Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role  Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role  giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female  Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti  sic  is equally flaccid An open ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II   something we definitely don t need  MASK OF FAMILIARITY</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Sadly  there is absolutely nothing original in this movie  The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone  turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers  I couldn t find a thing that elevated this movie above a     other like films  The plot is standard  a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history  A standard  run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it s too late  Everything happens exactly on cue  in order  with no surprises  and no frights  This movie is safe and boring  it really couldn t have been any better if it tried  Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman  playing a nice guy for a change  can help the dullness of the script Even the title is a misnomer  Although the original title  Maskerade  isn t any better And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres  Unmasked

 It s more like a museum exhibit than a simple book  Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too  although it is clearly written for adults  Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno Kaunas ghetto all in one place Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this Bonus  pages from the diary of

looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick    Split jump    Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump  She is also not kicking her boots up Pictures on vugames  makers of the game    Stroking    Barbie s body is crooked  She doesn t have her weight over her stroking leg  and her body is leaning to the side  I ve never seen anyone stroke like this  Bad skating technique</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My daughter received this cd for Christmas  It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen  When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate  only one choice worked   my daughter kept asking what she could do now  Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully  Not very interactive  I consider this a waste of space on my computer  a waste of time for us to use  I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile  A complete waste</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this for my   year old s birthday  While I think the graphics are really great  the concept stinks  My daughter told me she thinks it is boring  and she LOVES Barbie  and last night she even said she hates it  At least my    month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it    year old BORED with this after   weeks</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done  so I thought that this would be too  It was an absolute waste of money  The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic  There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level  I can t imagine a child above the age of   or   getting any enjoyment from this game  Barbie s Boring Ice Show</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is the WORST CD ROM game I have ever seen  My   year old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour  It is slow  skippy  etc  running on a new computer  Don t waste your money like we did  skip right over this dud  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY  BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>All the other reviews say this product is boring and  save your money     Well my daughter   I LOVE IT You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters  You pick her one of  AT LEAST    costumes  Somebody said the skater  never falls    Thats boloney  She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN  FUN game takes  It s a GREAT cd rom for any age  Have some fun for pete s sake  This world is SO NEGATIVE  I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show    IT S GREAT </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven  She enjoys it very much  It works perfectly with Windows XP  I like the fact that it has skill levels  which helps avoid the  frustration factor   which I m sure most of you reading this have experienced  The only reason that I did not give it a     is because it is quick to complete  especially on the  easy  and  medium  levels  Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie  I feel this game is not for the    crowd  A good game to buy </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My daughter  almost    loves this game  She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day  We did have to upgrade our system  but the game hasn t crashed since and hasn t been slow  Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels   The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them   This game has even seemed to help my daughter s actual skating   she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went  Great Game</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>For anybody who s looking for the      movie with Lauren Bacall   this is not it   Actually it s a    minute CBS music video by a group called  Perfect Gentleman  with   titles on it   Ooh la la  and  One more Chance   This is not a rating of this video  I didn t bother watching it  but just of the fact that there s absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn t the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it  That s even more

Ash  The most charming  captivating work from LJ Smith </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I usually hate teenage romance books  but this book is great  I love the transition the characters go through and the romance  This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations  She mixes charm  romance  and humor  This book feels like real  even though it is horror  which makes you wonder  My favorite line in the book is  This is a paranormal disaster area   Beautiful Love Story</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Daughters of Darkness is the best yet   I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away  I must have read it    times   I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself  I really hope there s another book on those two  The Best Yet   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I just re read Daughters of Darkness for about the    th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it  It has everything that you could want and more  Just one questionAre Mary Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart  longing for the one person who can make their life complete To find out keep reading   The Best</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have read nearly all of the books in the Night world series  and I have to say that this one is my favourite  without a doubt  It is Ash of course that just makes this book  he is irrestible  I became hooked on him from the very first  I guess it s the whole  bad boy  vampyre thing he s got going on that you become addicted to him  I started reading these books years ago  but they went out of print  I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them  I would recommend these books to anyone of any age  I mean I m    now  and I still love them  Soul mates</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>It was this book nearly    years ago that made me fall in love with L J  Smith and her writing  I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness  yet this book remains dear to my heart  The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan  Jade  and Kestrel   but you will especially fall in love with Ash  Look for Ash again in the  th book of the series when he makes another appearance  This book is fantastic  Possibly the Best out of this series </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance  Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time  I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel  Amazing </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L  J  Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that  I loved the way L  J  Smithdescribed all the characters  especialy Ash  and gave them all completely different personalities  This is  by far  one of the best books I ve ever read and I can t wait for STRANGE FATE to come out  For anyone who is looking for another good series by L  J  Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies  One of the best books I ve ever read </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I ve read all of L J Smiths books up until TheHuntress which of course isn t out yet and Ihave to say  that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far  I mobsessed with Ash and Mary Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK Daughters of Darkness THE BEST</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Out of all L J Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended  If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash one of the main characters   who seems to pop up in many scenes  The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters  During the entire novel she dosn t appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World finding her soulmate vampire and befriending   rogue vampires  Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in  I find the whole concept of the Night World wild powers and soulmates fascinating this book is worth it  One of her best in the Night World series </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I just loved Daughters of Darkness   I must of read it about    times  really  It s such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times  But it didn t really explain how Jeramey got there  How would he how where they were going    Humans and   vampires after a vampire slayer</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I ve only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series  but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers  Ash is my favourite male character    Did anyone notice that  so far  only Ash and Mary Lynnette tried to fight their attraction  But why was it called  Daughters of Darkness  when Rowan  Kestrel and Jade weren t actually the main characters P S  I think L  J  Smith should let more characters become vampires  And how come all the main character vampires are all male and the witches female    I m hooked and I want some more    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m writng again to say that this book has so many correct details  and the other books in this series are correct too  For instance  Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times  real witches do to  Isis is a a major person in witchcraft  and Hecate was the first witch  L j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has L J  Smith has so many correct details    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I like it  It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night  It was great   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this book because I am a nonogram  also called Paint By Number  addict  and can t get enough of this type of puzzle  My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing  The paper is poor quality  it won t hold up under much erasing if you use pencil  and if you use gel pens  the ink bleeds through to the other side  The squares to color in are too large  making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out  Also  the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle  instead of left and top  making it more difficult for a right handed person to see while solving Save your money  and buy the Games Magazine publication instead  Disappointing</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy  boring and a waste of time  Hofstader  a brilliant and yet very human scholar  has offered us a wonderfully concise  compelling and illuminating read   a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation  He has done all the work  not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion  but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy  very readable manner  The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review Bravo Professor Hofstader  I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece  mirroring the reader</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class  I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long  boring text  If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time  most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information  but it s dry  overly intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested  If you re looking for a challenge to read  you face two  deciphering the nealry     pages of rediculously long sentences  and staying awake  I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time  because the energy you must invest to understand this work  coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it  Don t Waste Yout Time</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration  This is not the type of book to bring to the beach  Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar  he writes very monotonously  if not thouroughly interested in american history at      i would not recommend this book  otherwise  if you are a history fanatic  this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time  Thick  dry and packed full of somewhat useful information</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Kylie Minogue isn t a very subtle performer   she s famous for hi NRG floorfillers  not purring ballads  A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare

actually Thomas stories but I was wrong  My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train    I was totally annoyed  Very annoying </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video  It s     listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe     Thomas related  What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a   minute story  And  there is only one song in the  Sing A Long   I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter  Next time  I will try to find those stories on video  They actually last about    minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don t know  Extremely Disappointed with this video</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is a DVD with footage of a  Come Out and Meet Thomas  day mixed in between the episodes  Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest  Still decent enough to rent  The DVD extras are limited and not very good  My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration  There is also a ton of toys shown during the  party interview  footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child  Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me  This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it  I wouldn t throw it out but I wouldn t buy it either  Just so so</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories  Turns out there are only ten  which is a typical Thomas DVD  However  between each story  it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas  As I parent  I m not interested in this  and I know that my   year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day  Plus  the sing along section has one song  One  We have other Thomas videos that has at least    and they aren t special DVD s  just normal Thomas collections  I wouldn t recommend this to anyone  if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections  More than Thomas  Not Geared Toward Children As Much</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unless I missed something  there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD  The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms  Allcroft  Waste of money  A long promo for the Thomas

interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product It s also AWFULLY frustrating that you can t jut

couldn t get them on  they were so tight I couldn t get the button buttoned around the waist  What is going on  These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny    year old  not someone who is a little on the hefty side  Further  the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight          above and beyond the already rather pricy product  I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all  You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling  and there are  deals  out there from major store chains  I was really disappointed in this product and the seller  Go to WalMart and get their khakis  they are very inexpensive and wear like iron  So disappointed</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis

Fantastic Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Although the images are very well rendered  they arefrightening  I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children  This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale  when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin  The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig s big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy  This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers  I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher  Disturbing</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Longing for vicarious travel  Imagining your college days  interrupted by an Italian adventure     which turns into one of the romantic kind  And full of the silly things that come with youth  attraction and confusion  I just wanted to add my two cents on this item  which I found  despite brief lapses in credibility  and hoppingly gullible moments  sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome  And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character  and the wonders of eating their special dishes  Fun and satisfying  A Taste of Italy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>     or a lazy afternoon  This book is like watching a romantic movie  It is interesting  feel good and  tasty   Capella has done a good job of holding the reader s interest with fun descriptions of food  chefs  Rome  locals and the Italian countryside I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did  You ll like this book if you are a romantic  a foodie  love to travel  love Italy and Italian food or all of the above  Perfect book for a long flight    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I found the book to be light hearted  fun and relatively fast moving  True  it was predictable  but that didn t detract from Capella s take on the triad of Bruno  Laura and Tomasso  In fact  it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story  The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere  though at times were a  trifle overdone   pun intended   The only thing that kept me from giving this a   was the author s descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic    too male  perhaps  like reading Playboy Penthouse letters    for my taste  In all  though  the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons  Delicious reading</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing  From page one I felt like I was in Italy  smelling the smells  seeing the sights and above all  tasting the food This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory  who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true  I devoured the book  pun intended  from start to finish  It made me appreciate food and its preparation  and we re booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food  this does for Italian  There is magic in preparing food for those you love  This is a fable  a romance  in the medieval sense of the word   It s about the magic and wonder of food and love  the sensual beauty of the world  Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read  I love to cook  I love to eat  I love my husband  This book made a great week for all three  It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things  cooking and uhmmmm  If you want to get INSPIRED too  then read this book   I d pair it with a couple of cooking books  like Cooking in the Nude  the one for newlyweds  Booty Food  Inter courses  or something like that  Enjoy a great book  I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If you are looking for something that entertains  tells a great story  and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone  or with the food  this is the perfect book  I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy  All who have read it  especially women  love it  One of the best </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I enjoyed this book   it was much better than the standard  chick lit  titles  It was a lightweight story  easy to read  and the Roman food  cooking  markets and people were fun  Didn t mind the creative cursing   how very true to  Roman young stud  it was  Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped  but I much prefered to read about Bruno I liked this book SO MUCH more than  Cooking for Mr  Latte    it was a fun read  Cameriere </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I didn t like the ending  the characterization leave something to be desired  and the writing didn t make me think  but  oh I didn t notice any of that  Well  except for the ending  at the time  or even until substatially after it was all over  During  I read and read  bathing in the glorious food descriptions  not to mention the allure of Italy  Oh Yes  Food porn  and I mean that in the best possible way</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>What a great read   tips on cooking lovemaking and Italian insults  Laughed and laughed  Thanks  Looking forward to

the book here in the states  and it was sold out everywhere   and to be honest  I am not sure why  All of the characters were not very well depicted  except for Laura  The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid  And the plot very predictible  The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out   there was no need for it in the book  I just can t seem to think of anything really good to say about this book   maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook  Not very good    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is one of the worst written books I have ever read I wish I had saved my money and my time The book is full of superlatives  Everything is  the best ever experienced  again and again The characters NEVER become embraceable  One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk  The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware  but is really just stupid  Her friend is promiscuous  which is all we ever really get to know of her The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader  But  the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader  Very inappropriate Not sure who would really like this book Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot  story development  characterization or any other facets of literature Find yourself something with a little more substance  and I think you ll be much happier  Do not waste your time    lousy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love It s a lot better when it deals with food than with love  In fact  food is not only a metaphor for love and love making but seems a more than adequate substitute  People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot  openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac  The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters  After that  the returns swiftly diminish Still  for a plane ride  one could do worse I suppose  The food is sexier than the sex</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group  No doubt about it  This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy  especially if you need a brush up on moving averages  etc  Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non financial analysis on various aspects of business  shipping and construction   this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion  A nice bedtable reader for the pre MBA  MBAs should look elsewhere  Back to basics</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>THERE BEATS ARE

ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it  They re CASH MONEY Millionaires  and why  Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats  They re millionaires because they repeat the words  huh    what   and  yeah  for every   or   minute song they make  They re millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires  Bottom line  HotBoys are garbage  and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label  I will NEVER consider this good music  and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what  so called  hip hop music is coming to   then I only hope it s worth your money cause I ain t gonna spend a penny on it  Just as trashy as garbage music comes

ever heard next to Juvenile s     Degreez which is definetely a   Star cd too  The Hot Boys put out an album with like   or   really strong songs  And as bunch of other average or a little better songs  Not really any horrible songs at all  The Best Songs are the main    I Need A Hot Girl    We On Fire    Respect My Mind     Tuesday   Thursday   Those   songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months  And i have over     cd s  So this cd must be good huh   Ridin   is another real tight one  Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like  Clear Tha Set  by Lil Wayne   Ya Dig  by Juvenile   Help  by B G   and  Bout Whatever  by Turk  I Think it s cool that all of them got there own solo songs   Too Hot  is nice too  along with the rest of the songs

thing that most people don t understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn t possibly sound the same as the game  When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it  but it just wouldn t be done  On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it  It was only about    bits if even that much  Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had  All in all i thought that this

my direct line  this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in       The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories  This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today  This would be a

know it is excellent  Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth el  and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies  In the process  have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash  unshackled by time  And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner  add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories All the elements are here  but the book never gets off the ground  In juggling so many elements in so short a space  Kushner gets lost  and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust  This would have been a good idea for two  maybe even three books  Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored  Too Much on the Mystical

socialism  the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature  it starts out as a political tract  then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end  For me  its process felt unsuccessful  but at least there are many places that can be quotable Quotable    to the point that I wanted to  in a half hearted daydream  to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde s own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards  While that project may not be worthwhile  the reading of this essay is worthwhile  An interesting little essay</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor  I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him  This film was well done  It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage  One thing that stood out to me  which bothered me  was that the  in laws  of Rani s character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan s character  I believe that once a family member has married someone  the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse  Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage  with the idea that the couple will live  Happily Ever After   However  the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage  And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage  Great Actors   Well done film </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is one of my favorite bollywood movies  If you re a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you ll

at the question of  then what   I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half  but I didn t think it was that excessive  The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face I d give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only   stars for the DVD quality  It s definitely pixilated in parts  not the best quality

from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze  The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE  I highly

only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes   bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship   a welcome change from the  pounce on each other in the first chapter  genre  Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts  A change from the Carpathian Series</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have really enjoyed Ms  Feehan s Dark series  so was eager to read her new book  This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine  Nicoletta has special  gifts  which her entire village tries to keep a secret  however  it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her  He has  gifts  of his own  Nicoletta isn t immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don  Unlike some authors  who use the  I hate you   temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters  Ms  Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it  The love scenes are wonderful  though not very plentiful  So if you re looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books  you may be dissappointed  I read this in one sitting and couldn t put it down  The story is riveting  Riveting</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Before I begin  let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series  Those books are great  This one had potential  but it just fell flat  Her characters simply weren t developed enough this time for me to relate to them  This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards  Not her best           </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book was a major disappointment  It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan s other novels  especially Dark Desire  something special  I found the book had very little action  little romance  and a  mystery  plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful  This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read  This one is missing that Feehan Spark</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>While I don t consider it the best of Ms  Feehan s books that I have read  The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid  The protaganists are believable and interesting  If you like Ms  Feehan s books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library  Intriguing story</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I Loved this book  Heart pounding romance and action  keep you going though the whole storie  I say this is a Must Read  amazing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book had great potential that it did not live up to  I hope she goes back to writing more  Dark Series  books  This book needed more action and more editing   it was way too long for the amount of plot it had      Too Boring</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I absolutely couldn t stand this book I m not understanding how it s sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely  The Don was a jerk  Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning  but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end  It s a sad thing when a woman  to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta s thoughts   leaves her old life behind because he ll never like it  and because she just HAS to   Eeeeew I loved the Dark series  and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one  This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms  Feehan s work  I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next  and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book Please  please  please   read something in the Dark series  or Emma Holly s Upyr series  You ll be a lot happier  Ick ack  Put it back </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>i was really disappointed with this book  The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull  it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn t take the time to make it interesting  i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn t read this one again  disappointed</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I first found Christine Feehan s work through  Dark Prince   It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series  I thought this book would be the same   not even close  The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum  Before I reached halfway I really didn t care about the characters  The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional  I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place  In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series  Please Christine don t write any more like this  Not up to scratch </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i m a big fan of Christine Feehan I enjoyed this book very much it had alot of suspense  paranormal and of course romance  The plot was great i got hooked from the begining  My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift  Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i m looking forward for her next book well done  WONDERFUL GOTHIC</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN    THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES    WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT   TO SPARK THE INTEREST    OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS  IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING   WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE END   TRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME   WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS   I LOVED IT    AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED     CAN T WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC   OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER   WELL DONE   YOU HAVE ANOTHER WINNER      CONGRATULATIONS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful  Ms  Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series  which I also adore   With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine s work  I highly recommend this book for one and all  An Old World change that s definitely wonderful</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Christine Feehan does it again  for all of you that have only read this one book by her  i strongly suggest that you read them all  Great Reading</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>First  let me say  I d heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan s my cup of tea and for some unknown reason  thought this was one in the series   no need to tell you  I was severely disappointed  and confused  This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the    s   blech  Lots of dark male broodiness  all written from the heroines point of view  and of course she s a young innocent virgin              edited to add  I really wish I had only given this one star  but it appears I can t change that now  I really wish i hadn t wasted my time</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I really like Christine Feehan  This book was very dissapointing  The plot had promise  Nicoletta was a sweet heroine  The prose were good  and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace  However  the plot flows like molasses in January  I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the  Dark  series  Couldn t finish it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ve had the camcorder for a while now  and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas  Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file  I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder  Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder  So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS  Do people still use VHS   but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast  I m going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money  Poor support</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Just as promised  worked well for what I needed  I have some old  mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection  Very Good</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light  However  the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi   Perhaps digital would have been better  but the price was a factor  I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available  Great for the money</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought it new in      for       The color is pretty good  The resolution is very poor  only close shot get you satified  Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes  I didn t use it a lot for the first   years  only the last   years I used it regularly to tape my daughter s piano class homework every   weeks for     minutes each time  Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start  It s common issue as the piano teacher told me    So I have to find a new camcorder now  I don t know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter s piano class  Low resolution and poor quality</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My one year old has played with this toy for several months  He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves  Not quite what I expected  He s had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again  and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make  The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises  also not quite what I expected  But it s noise I can deal with  The volume can be adjusted or turned off  through I myself can t distinguish between  soft  and  loud  on this thing   My son enjoys the toy  but it may be of limited or intermittent interest  Better than some out there </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My    month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it  He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises  It s fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up  Fun toy </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can t wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet s Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can t wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer         RKsbabydoll Cruel and Unusual</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I bought this book used and it was in very good condition  Also  I received it within a week  which was nice  Good Deal and Fast Shipping</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I listened to the audio version of  Cruel   Unusual  on a recent trip to New Jersey and back  The first     of the book kept me on the edge of my seat  then    the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end  Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals  all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment  After all the buildup  the  who  of the whodunnit ends up being    nobody in particular  And the fate of the evildoer  Nothin  much  Disappointing  Won t bother with Dr  Scarpetta or Ms  Cornwall again I m a little baffled by all the reviews that say   great book  bad ending     and still give it   stars or more  Isn t a mystery DEFINED by the ending  by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings      of a great book  then    blah</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book was a bit more difficult to follow  in my opinion  I was lost toward the end  But Patrica is an awesome writer  I m sure the problem was me  not her writing  Review</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell  This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor  Love Scarpetta</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Here is a summary of my impressions   It was written for about the  th grade level   There was virtually no  grab  for the first     of the book  I simply trudged through  That is highly unusual for a crime book   The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters  This happened multiple times  You ll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages   But most of all  there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way  That is paramount in a good crime book In summary  don t bother  If you do  you ll be asking the same thing I did   I want my    hours back that I wasted on this book  Harris LevinCruel and Unusual  A Kay Scarpetta Novel A really bad book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My first foray into this writer was her latest book  Scarpetta  I enjoyed it    so I purchased this effort and several others she had written  I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies  After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating  It becomes trite  formula type writing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I must say I was required to read this book for a class  If that had not been the case  I would have put the book down half way through it  I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims  Quite frankly  I was very disappointed by this book  Just Plain Cruel Will Do</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel  easy to read and a page turner  It gripped me until the end  Enjoy  Cruel and Unusual</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>In a word  Lacking  Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which  as a result  I found rather vacuous and inauthentic  So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did  No offence Patricia  I guess it was a mystery</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book  Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell  The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set  not as a cassette set  so I ordered it  I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book  I wrote  through Amazon  to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it  Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book  so I wouldn t have to pay the Library charge   I now had to give that job to the library  Need I say more This time  and it s the first time  Amazon has a very disgruntled customer Thanks for asking for the review  Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced Sincerely Sherry BohmP S  Yes  my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers  We re just going to have to be more careful now  Inproper Advertising</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Like the ones before  this book is a solid forensic and police procedural  A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene  How could that have happened  I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay s niece  Lucy  again  as she is    now and her own person  no longer a child  Lucy s computer skills continue to amaze  I look forward to reading the next in the series  Note  There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well  I d recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter s Field  Solid Addition to the Series</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I could not give this book a full   starts  For whatever reason  the book seemed to  bog down  and I just wanted it to end  I will continue to read the series  but this one was not my favorite  Still Loving Scarpetta</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists  Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth  Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve  Great</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very very good      I can usually figure out who did it  not this time  so many complicated twists and turns  Great read    Another one done   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The book was excellent  I was barely able to put it down  I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more  Cruel and Unusual</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The good  The basic plot line is interesting  a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene  The writing itself is good  The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well  fleshed out  The bad  Other characters are not well  fleshed out   The plot never fully explains itself  Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes   or is it about Scarpetta   redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her   after developing an anti social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one  The latter seems to be the path the author choose   leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved  Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain  on many different levels   as a family member  as a friend and as a professional  in the end her  goodness  is redeemed  How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant   which I found to be a major flaw  Muddled ending disapoints</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away  I never thought I d warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L  Sayers  but Ms  Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart C   E was by far the most fascinating book I ve ever read  I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel  devouring every word  as I couldn t go to bed until I had finished it  The only disappointment was the ending  The killer came out of the blue  and there were too many loose ends The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books  It s been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read  Spellbound </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I really liked this book  It is a page turner for sure  I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel  Very nice book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field  it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview  The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated  for example  there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation  For some unclear reason  two sections on editing are separated by    pages on usability testing  If you are actually involved in technical writing  there are better books  Too scattered  too shallow</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This movie was not only NOT funny  but it was excruciatingly boring  I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats  Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be  it was still better than this garbage  Soooooooooooo NOT Funny</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>When the film first started playing  my partner and I looked at each other as if to say  What on earth is this      but we decided to give it a chance and let it play   for about half an hour before we couldn t bare to watch any more  The title says  Funny    it wasn t  The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film   but it was in no way funny at all  The jokes were terrible  the script was terrible  Very disappointing  Totally Unfunny</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman  In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film  Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film  Nasty People  Nasty Film </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>those guys ARE OVERATED   ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY  NOPE  STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS    C MON AMERICA   WAKE UP    zero star</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler s worst effort  He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic  but he came across as being apathetic about the role  The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him  which made the climax of the film lackluster  It was occasionally funny  considering the title and cast of comedians  who played comedians  The last    minutes  the film changes pace entirely  as if it wasn t floundering enough  and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama  Despite all the big names and cameo appearances  the only real stand out was Leslie Mann  who plays Sandler s ex  She was the only lively force in the cast  but sadly  alone she wasn t enough to bring it back into focus  You re not missing a thing  Dramedy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana  but this is probably one of the worst movies I ve ever seen  It was like   or   movie plots stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down  over and over  I just kept wondering when it was going to end  I should have walked out like so many others did Some may like  but it s NOT my cup of tea  The Not so Funny People</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>His movies seem to be going down hill  The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it  Other then that  it is just not that funny  Dont let it trick you  only see this if its free  What happend Sandler </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life his friends and a beautifull woman he meets  serious comedy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie  which is not necessarily a bad thing  but it kind of is here  First of all it s not funny  It s about  comedy  but I wouldn t consider the movie itself to be a comedy  although there are a few funny things in it I suppose  This movie seems like it s all over the place  It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much  Some people might like the story  but it was pretty dull to me  Long  somewhat dull and unfocused</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian  George Simmons  who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug  He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna be Ira Wright  Seth Rogen  attempting stand up  Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go fer  Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it  George plays the death card to patch up relationships  then suddenly he isn t going to die anymore  George re examines his life  but even at mid life he is still an immature a hole  Everyone has sex but Ira  which seems to be a sad joke I found the jokes and humor to be at best  lame  The language was crude and sexual  Brief nudity  Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit coms look really lame  If you think a guy saying  tweet  over and over again  spinning around in a circle is funny  then this movie is for you  WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Intelligent  funny  sad  real  with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler For a lot of it s length I thought it would be a truly great film  but some clunky  almostsit com plot turns in the last      a little too much length  and not quite there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie  not a great one None the less  far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press  Far better than its reputation  and well worth a look</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script  Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c  k jokes  There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts  Maybe it is a marketing problem  Or  maybe just lazy writing  Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian  Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama  Starts out with promise  but then goes downhill </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wow  I usually like Adam Sandler   Judd Apatow Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it  I don t think I laughed once during the entire movie  Not even a chuckle  It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film  The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow s ensemble doesn t seem to work with Sandler s schtick  I loved  Knocked Up  and     Year Old Virgin  but there doesn t seem to bee much chemistry with this group  I was waiting for  Bruno  to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation  I almost bought this  I m so glad I only rented it  Not so Funny people </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>An acceptable movie  with some good moments by Adam Sandler  and some of the other new American comedy guys  but very far from his really  funny people  involved movies  like  ANGER MANAGEMENT   with Jack Nicholson  or the hilarious  LITTLE NICKY   Obviously  not Adam Sandler s best</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie  They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up  When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it  My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it  I don t watch a lot of TV  but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while If you re into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight  then you re going to like this film  However  if you re looking for humour like Adam Sandler s previous films  i e  Happy Gilmore  etc  then you can forget about it I give this film   star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film     Not what I expected   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Not much to say about this movie   i am a huge Adam Sandler fan  and i love him in anything    but this movie was looooong and booooring    The comedy skits in the movie weren t funny   at all   i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating   cocks   and farting    you would like it  Like i said  not much to say    i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my      back     Couldn t give it less than one star    or i would ve    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is one of the worst movies I have seen  The dialogue is awful  There

anyone could give it   stars  This movie was the worst   hours of my life  I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie  I felt like I was watching   movies at once  Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them it s a waste and to rent something else  Worst movie I ve ever seen</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago  i said to her  this is real stupid  i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending  She said   we saw this movie already  and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument  she claims WE saw it and i said  Vat   i am getting alzheimers Finally we figured it out  we started to watch this movie together about   months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies  but this one really eats the bird skip it            worst film ever</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny  This however  just  well  wasn t  I really do believe that this movie had potential  but there was so much going on  so many stories within the story  that they could have made   movies out of it It s   and a half hours long  That s about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot  This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic  or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out There is very little humor in Funny People  The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there  which is probably why  in my opinion at least  that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn t go straight to DVD  The L O N G E S T movie    EVER </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate   trailer trash movie like this but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them  this movie is as funny as a sewer  all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity virtually ever second word  the writer who has very little  if not any intelligents  has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly   yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity  however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing  if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you  profanity the movie    or profanity and the degenerates    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A truly great example   of how terrible some movies have become   Vulgar   Offensive  Unnessisary nudity   I usually love Adam Sandler   and can t believe he d stoop so low in this role  Seth is highly likeable in this   but still swears and lowers himself as well  The woman who plays Adams  romantic interest  is mostly great   but also stoops to swearing   blantant sexuality  The writing is the worst in this movie  This awful movie is   hours and    minutes long   but only feels like   hours    And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow  I suggest skipping this movie altogether   Tragic where movies have gone to  Much has been lost  Scott MacNeil   comedian

Depressing then becomes boring</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless  Some may call it  complex   but I call it crap  There are a few little laughs here and there   but nothing that would make this worth sitting through  Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious content     it still sucks  Don t waste your money  Watch  I love you man  or  Grandma s Boy  or something that is actually entertaining  I wish someone had warned me  Please just run far FAR away from this film </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of    sucking    Even Adam Sandler  one of my favorite actors of all times  sucked too  big time    There are funny

of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts   it  the only reason i think its not really funny is because theres none of those funny parts like knocked up of the   yr old virgin has  dont pay attention to the reviews rent the movie or something if u like it buy it  great movie  movie is longer than  hours</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am big fan of Judd Apatow s work  i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies  that it has a more somber  serious tone  so my expectations were tempered  I liked it  i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long  which is why I take off one star  But if you go in knowing this isnt a    year old virgin knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed  with that being said  i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in  Not entirely a comedy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This movie was not an original concept  The jokes were lame  as

funny story  A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat s eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early   th Century  It s a love story

disappointed  I think everyone will love this illustrated novel Jorma The Rabbi s Cat is the cat s meow </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Rabbi s Cat is a wonderful book  I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book  The book is in the form of a comic strip  each box lovingly illustrated by the author  The pictures are wonderful  particularly of the cat  They are a joy to behold Even better are the stories  anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties  The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny  The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches  Through the difficult medium of comics  the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place  Much of the book is given to musings about life  philosophy  love  God and so on  If you like a good discussion  you ll enjoy this book Although the books can be enjoyed by non Jews  I think if you don t know the basics of Judaism  you ll be missing the most vital part of the book  Of course  the book is so appropriate for the cat lover  The author clearly understands cats perfectly  A wonderful  funny sad book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won t repeat it  However  I will emphasize what was not commented on  The Author is a very talented artist  He takes risks on many pages and it works  resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text  The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying  I hope there is a book to follow  I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs  good artwork too </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td> The Rabbi s Cat   by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar  is a whimsical  charming fable featuring a rabbi  his lovely daughter  and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat  Both protagonist and narrator  the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments  often sardonically  on the actions of the humans around him  Set in pre World War II Algeria  with a lengthy detour to Paris  the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural  social and religious backgrounds  In this multilayered environment  the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place  Delightful  exotic world seen through a cat s eyes</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi  his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her  The tale seems promising at first  until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws  The cat represents the glorification of sin itself  and delights whenever the book s characters fall into ungodly habits  judging them forever as hypocrites  taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin   As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God  At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi  thus giving the tale a  happy ending   In short   The Rabbi s Cat  is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists  atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self serving  do as you feel  lifestyles One more note  This book  despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover  is definitely not appropriate for children  Self Serving Message</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>As someone who is interested in different cultures  I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people s thoughts  Instead  I open it to find a swearing cat  he uses the F word  denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites  in a lame stereotypical way  Might be interesting to others  but its not interesting to me  Not only is it not suitable to children  but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either  I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book  Not what it looks like on the cover </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill s side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms  Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up  I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November  Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up  The Last dissenting Witness</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Since writing my review of

during the assassination  but used her unique location  and her active imagination to keep herself in the limelight for years  It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end  It was laughable Someone needed to ask her about the  little dog  she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie   Look at the original interviews  she actually said it  This book is BS from stem to stern  Go read a fairy tale  at least there s a moral at the end  The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter  Drivel</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very disappointing read  Starts with her tale of what she saw in      then devolves into another  MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY  work  Offering no documentation to

slapped an ending onto the book  A superhuman villian was terminated too easily  The method of capture was not adequately developed  Several promising themes were not followed up by the author  especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault s uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation  The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have read all Patricia Cornwell s book

</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Well  that s no fun  Honesty is the best policy  right  This was the first of Patricia s books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with  I ve tried reading another of her works  but I can t get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except  perhaps  to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe  More than that  this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story If you can t say anything nice </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is a great read  a lot of fun  I d recommend it to anyone who likes the genre  On the down side  I think that Gault is a little too evil    he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game  Also  I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more  she s a good character  but needs more depth Great read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This could be the worst novel I have ever read  It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read  There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here  so here are but three points     The main character  Kay Scarpetta  is an insufferable  humorless snob  I d never before read a novel where I hated the main character  Great job  Pat     About     of the novel is dialogue  Very bad dialogue  But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose     The story is predictable and boring  and the ending is utterly ridiculous  I m astonished that this book was ever published  let alone made the bestseller lists  You have GOT to be kidding</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This supposed  thriller  is mind numbingly dull and inept   I had to give up half way through  My brain froze over</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I loved Patricia Cornwell s first five novels  sadly  her sixth loses its edge   I wanted to enjoy it   but the plot labors on   and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn t wait to read  We lose Scarpetta s forensic  grit  and instead focus on a bizarre  rather boring computer plot   I hope the next books in the series are better  Losing her edge </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I m not a fan of the crime writing genre  so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel  Unfortunately  I cannot speak highly of From Potter s Field I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine  so it makes me suspicious of the novel s factual integrity when I read that a murderer s eyes are  as pale blue as a malamute s   when in fact  according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America   a malamute s eyes MUST be brown  never blue It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies  and the media    in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country s highest profile serial killer  Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer s family tree  Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs  so I suppose I should quit complaining Well  I read the book right through to the end  and it kept me amused  so I have to give it one star  The devil in the detail</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If you love meaningless running around  plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief  andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies  you might put up with this one  Otherwise       the book disappoints  One gets the impression that it was written in haste  A pale imitation of the previous work      deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables  if not in a Potter s Field for books   The pits       a contrived pot boiler  Avoid it </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Having read all of Patricia Cornwell s books  I was very disappointed about her latest achievment  Draging the villain through   separate books probably wasn t her best idea  Even more disturbing  The characters of her main heros  Scarpetta  Marino  Lucie  were described inconsistent with her previous books So far  the worst book of one of my favorite authors</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell s worst book she has written  It s not the characters  nope  It s not the writing that is wrong  It s the story that makes the book disappointing Temple Gault has struck again  This time we know this for sure  Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do  Someone from Lucy s past is also back  The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book  He is not scary or very threatening  It s not exiting  Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta s  Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I m not sure if it would be that exiting  For a killer on the loose plot its very weak  of coarse the forensics are very good and original  But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel  Very Dissapointing</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am on my  th Scarpetta story  I most enjoy the relationships Cornwell develops     Marino s gruff demeanor and language are so colorful   Dr  Kay is a strong female figure who uses her brain to handle the men who would take her down   The development of Lucy s character is interesting  but it is time she  too  develop into a stronger person emotionally  Cornwell s work is  for me  as good as Grisham s  Intelligently written  a fast and suspenseful read </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well seasoned author  The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed  The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read  Boy

super  I found all the other character two dimensional and all the  intrigue  regarding super computers insulting to my intelligence  Has Cornwell done better  I don t know and  after reading this  am in no big hurry to find out  A wildly implausible thriller</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Christmas is always a notoriously bad time for Kay Scarpetta  Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia and consulting forensic pathologist for the FBI  When Temple Gault  a cunning serial killer whose killing spree began in Richmond several years earlier  resurfaces in New York with the murder of a female transient left in frozen Central Park  Scarpetta jumps head first into the investigation  The identity of the homeless woman becomes top priority  and when it is discovered who she is  the investigation is spun into a radical new direction  Meanwhile  Gault has set his sights on Scarpetta herself   leading to one final  terrifying encounter in the fetid tunnels below the city A fascinating book with wonderful characterization  grisly accuracy and a high voltage  suspensful ending  The Scarpetta series is the best  When it comes to crime fiction  no one does it better than Cornwell  From Potter s field  buried with no name</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read  She is a compelling storyteller  and she obviously possesses great knowledge of the subject matter  I do admit to finishing the book in a two day period  but it was more to get to the inevitable final showdown between Scarpetta and the killer  Scarpetta and some of her cronies are characterized well  but the killer seemed a bit stereotypical  I don t believe in reading ahead and spoiling the surprise  but in this case I skipped some detailed sections to find out how the killer would be stopped in his tracks Since reading this book  I have read Cause of Death by Cornwell and would rate that book slightly higher than this one  This book is not her best that I ve read so far  but it wouldn t prevent me from reading another one This is a good  focused  and knowledgable writer who does not need to fall back on unbelievable killers and sensantional plot devices to tell an imaginative story  Impressive delivery but plot lacking in believability</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>At least  that s how I felt about this book  which seems only to have been published because the author has written some truly interesting previous novels  I recommend the first three books in the series  I cannot recommend this book for anything except kindling  However  not having a fireplace

happend  people just called  In fact  I think this books had some bad editing  I felt as though all what was needed was there  and that someone just yanked out the big sections for no reason I am still a fan  but this one is a skipper The doc just happens  to see the resturante that the killer was using The polices offer in charge is left in the subway with two people who are not police  Just does not at add  a let down</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I found this plot to be to contrived in that many of the scenes were just to clearly made up for me to become vicariously involved  The twists and turns in the plot were simply to convenient for me to appreciate a sense of natural flow that good novels must have  For example  The scene in which Gault  the killer  has been seen using the same restaurant that the main character spontaneously finds herself in  Imagine  in New York no less  Not only that  but the killer is using the main characters visa in the same restaurant  And then the genius software engineer niece who just happens to be working on a huge computer program in the law enforcement field  I m sorry  but this tale is just to unbelievable  It might make a passable B grade film  but I wouldn t want to see it  To contrived and therefore not plausible</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book reads like the tin man in the Wizard of Oz walked BEFORE he was oiled  Jerky

This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted  or is planning to do either  because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice Unfortunately  there are some erroneous ideas in this book  Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy  he also seems to think that capitalism s merit lies in its service to the  common good   However  these fallacies are rare  and they do not significantly detract from the book For a great back to back lesson in

push it forward  That s a fine argument and all  but that s not teaching  Metaphors are mental manipulation    give me all the pros and cons and let me decide  Or better  give me the damn facts And it s outdated too  The book is    years old  We are so NOT in Post WWII economics  This ain t no economics book </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon The book is one long  myopic  libertarian apology  No lessons learned</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is an excellent introduction to Economics  Hazlitt was a clear writer  and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative  You don t have to be a student of Economics   this is a book that can benefit every reader  I just wish more of our politicians had read this book  Best book on Economics for the general reader</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple  so simple they go unnoticed  principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix I could have easily given this     stars  but I didn t have the option  The only thing that kept me from giving it   was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions  Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy  If you don t have this  get it </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships  what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off  Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy   its awesome   This dork probably marches against the WTO  Read the angry anti Hazlitt reviews for a real indication</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple  understandable language  If you are just starting out on economics  I would recommend this as your first book  College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L W  Mises are pretty hard for a beginner Also  be sure to give this book to your children  Schools don t teach economics  a most important of subjects With that said  I would like to comment on many   star reviews  Notice how they don t comment on the content of the book  Economics is a Science  and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it  Give this book to a your children </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Economics in One Lesson is another great  must read  book  Like Bastiat s  The Law   it is short and sweet  At the same time  it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress  state legislatures  county commissions and city councils  the overwhelming majority of these so called  leaders  are utterly ignorant Don t you be one of them Buy and read Economics in One Lesson Then call up your politicians and give them an earful  ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sure  a few of the specific examples cited     years ago are no longer relevant today  but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and  higher education  without learning the first thing about economic science  while getting bombarded with self serving economic propaganda   Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then  while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased Here s a revolutionary fantasy  Make this book a required study by all high school students  Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future BTW  you can get the nice hard cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute  Never more needed than today</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>For all who avoided economics like the plague  this is the book for you very informative  and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject    Check it out   next time you argue economics with uncle Fred  you wont sound like such a dope Economics even you will Understand</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a great start to learning Austrian economics  or rather  any kind of economics  All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills  Peter Schiff s  Crashproof  would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson  And for the more serious student of Austrian economics  especially in these times  you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit  and Rothbard s The Great Depression  Simply brilliant </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>As a student and teacher of economics  this book has proved to be an invaluable resource  The lesson is simple and direct  yet one that many people fail to apply  This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy  or any other arm of policy making  for that matter   Whether you agree with Hazlitt s conclusions about how the market works or not  you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book  It is entertaining to read  particularly easy for a book about economics  I highly recommend it  One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past    years Upon reading this book  and knowing your fellow Americans will have  one couldn timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now  An absolute must read  Textbook</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is not a new book perhaps that s why it is so useful There is no gobblygook  no arcane economic theories with fancy lables What there are in this book are many examples of     if the government takes this action to make this or that happen  the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different  and usually not positive Sound experiential economics in my view  clearly written  and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt  subsidizes this or that interest  taxes one interest at the expense of another  etc I liked it  I could read and understand it  Our Senators and Reps should read and heed</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very easy to read  simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric  I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it  I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading  but it s not necessary  and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately  aka every modern economic issue  has an obligation to read this book  Great Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I wouldn t recommend this book to an enemy  True  the information may be worthy  but the writing style and the narration were horrible  It is definitely NOT written  nor read  in a conversational manner  I m willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written  however better inflection  phrasing  pauses  etc    would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book I couldn t even finish it  I suffered through the first   disks and after all that investment in time I couldn t bring myself to listen to the  th  Its just that poorly written I ll restate the fact that the message    the information    is worth hearing  its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn t stand to hear it through the end I think I ll donate it to my local library  Painful</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am in my    s and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education  economics  I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner s Worldly Philosophers  a satisfying but very general overview as I recall  I probably read Heilbroner in the late    s I m an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them  I can only say that the book was dated  full of economic events that were referenced from WWII  and excessively polemical and rigid I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number      I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was I think the book should be retitled  Economics in One Polemic  The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late      s and the      s  Unsatisfactory and very outdated</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine  I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated  one sided book  Don t Be Fooled By the Title of This Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics  In no way is this book objective  it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda  He rarely shows two sides of the arguement  spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws  DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK  and if you do read it  take it with a grain of salt  Hypocritical  Biased  outdated and misleading</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced  this is a straightforward  but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation  Funny that west European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime  better education  better health care  better TV programmes than the US  They also organise their politics better  so that the tax money is better spent  It did set me right on one or two points  and parts are written in a spuriously funny way  but it is too biased to be really informing   Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn t agree with If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice  Capitalism straight  in small unpalatable doses</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The problem I have with Hazlitt s economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right libertarian ideology Hazlitt attempts to  explode liberal myths  by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last    years  The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and  therefore  humanity Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the  successes  of liberalized trade policies throughout the world  A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy  Right libertarian views presented as fact</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book  It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation  It is hopelessly out of date  ASTOUNDING</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics  If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh s readers or helpers writing a primer on economics  then this is it  Keep government small etc  The author most likely was an Austrian school follower  As it is avaiable free on Limewire  maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library  No need to buy unless you want to flesh out  sic  the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al  The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall  self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad  how to fail economics    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very Stupid  Once you enslave your mind to a blind  fantasy based  utopian distortion of capitalist society  which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level  at anytime whatsoever  and the top beneficiaries wouldn t have it any other way   no matter what this economic libertarian garbage espouse   this is what comes out of your pencil  Read this book  turn off the real world  and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian utopian rehash of greed  plunder  pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as  common sense   Read this if You re Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities  It is amazing to me that a book written in      is still so fundamentally relevant  Back to basics   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Particularly appropriate for these times  even many decades after it was written   Hazlitt s Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the   th Century  This book is a fairly easy read for non economists and  though a bit repetitive towards the end  quite enlightening  I d recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy  A great alternative perspective</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is economic sanity  Easy to understand  If more people and especially those in government would read this book  we would be better off  Sanity in Economics</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a great primer that should be read in all schools  Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here  Intead  Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person  it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues  And  of course  how you think is the basis for what you think  Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness  many of which spring from the same bad premises  the same elementary blindness to cause and effect  Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime  Fine Summary</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book is a little outdated  and a little heavy on the libertarianism  but otherwise it s a very easy read  and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas  A good libertarian primer</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Just under two hundred pages  I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College  Concise  well worded and simplified reality  Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt  Important</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon  Basic principles easy to understand even for the non economist  but topics were not oversimplified  Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times

problems though originally written in the    s  Frighteningly Prophetic</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a great introduction to economic analysis  It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene  Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake  that of ignoring the unseen possibilities  or opportunity cost   Great book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won t be my last  He has an  Adam Smith  way of writing  whether intentional or not  who s to tell  and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations  I quickly curbed my enthusiasm  This is a good book  not great and I m not quite sure why all the great reviews  I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles  maybe not economics      In summary  well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it s title  Great summary of some very difficult economic principles</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Wow  this one is really out there  Only Any Rand and Ron Paul  who know nothing about economics  could recommend this book  For example  consider these laughable claims  that I paraphrase  The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups There is no difference between supply and demand The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses It is all very simple  listen to me If you can believe this stuff  read the book  You can get it online for free  over simplified diatribe</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view  The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter  After skimming a few pages I threw it away  I didn t even want it in the house  More politics  less economincs</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is propaganda  not an economics lesson  The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda  I couldn t be less happy with this purchase  This book s title is misleading </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Bottom line  there are some serious flaws in the author s thinking  For example  in chapter     Tariffs   the author argues that imposing a    tariff on an import  sweaters from England  ends up costing the US  Never once does he add the    duty received into the equation  How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax  When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports  I quit reading In short  I couldn t agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs benefits focus is too narrow  Yet  in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the  too narrow   the author s analysis in fact is often too narrow  Seriously Flawed</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Going to be brief here  If you are looking for an introductory to economics  begin your search elsewhere  Hazlitt has an opinion  and he presents it here  I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues  but more importantly  spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals This book fails in that respect  Keep looking   Samuelson  Mankiw  Malkiel     Not a primer  way too political</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it  because I realized it is nothing

American you should stay away from this book  Straight to the trash can </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Let me first say I m into HipHop real Hiphop  slug  Atmosphere  etc   I have latelly been checking

first bite  Can t wait  on order</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times  It s fairly comfortable for a bustier corset style waist cincher  The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette  most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly   I m pleased with the product  One thing I will say on the negative side is that I m rather short  These are more of a one size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I m       Not an issue  it s meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants  but I m already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans  Not the best for sitting  whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn t do that  The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised  Long torso but great product</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all  I do suggest finding your correct size  not the size you think you are  The terry cloth lining absorbs all

and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back  This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL  Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw   tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half way covering my butt   hips  EUREKA   What a difference this made now i m loving it and hardly leave home without it  I originally bought the XL nude now i m getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L  Great product  my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer  Had some problems at first but now i love it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have the nude version of this chincher in small I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus  I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive  This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation  I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists The length is fine on me  going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones  I am  ft   The cinching effect takes about         inches off my waist comfortably  enough to get into my vintage dior I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss   but I think I will give it a try  Good choice for getting a vintage look</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am pleased with this item  It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso  but everyone is different of course I wear it a lot and it has held up well  It is rubbery  so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires  Squeem works well</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size   when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small         AND THERE IS NO

small   NO RETURNS</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>this product does exactly what it says it does  the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on  the hook and eyes are

being to big  The item is also like it is made from rubber  but because I needed it for this weekend I don t know what I am going to do at this point  Wasn t what I expected</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>provides great support and slims me down by   inches when I wear it  I ordered a size small   The size chart is very accurate  it fits like a glove  great</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I do believe this product is very good but  in my case  the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything  I am already petite  so the cincher doesn t significantly reduce my waistline  It does  however  make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour glass like  You cannot really wear it under thin clothing  as others have pointed out  and  for me  it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days   the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation   but I still recommend the product  It is a very good and very cool cincher  I think it can even be worn on top of clothing  for a goth or fetish look  It is well made and makes clothes look better on you  a good smoother</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I bought this item for my wedding dress  I wanted to make sure that I  tried out  the cincher before my big day and it works really well  I started out with this same item  in a Small   but it gave me  back fat  which I do not normally have   I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm  When wearing the cincher you have two  size options  with the double hook closure  which allows you to let it out more around the bust   tighter around your  natural  waist to create a better shape  It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material def makes you sweaty   but it DOESNT move around  Totally worth it Kinda painful   the boning pushes into my  under side boob  probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs    size    DD Ladies  if it helps  I am        lbs busty  not super skinny but not fat size    in jeans  Works Well </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love this  I had been looking in I don t know how long for this kind of product  I ve had   babies so far and haven t found a product like this  I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette  but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up  I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts  but I ve had it for a week already  I ordered all    black   beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps and I ve already got used to wearing it everyday  it s pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look  I love it  now I m just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist  I ve read that it can last up to over a year  so deffinitly worth the money  Would recommend this to everyone  squeem cincher</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I wore this for my wedding since I hadn t lost all of my pregnancy weight  It was great for a little bit  But then started getting a crease around my waist  I can t wear it anymore  Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours  They suggest wearing it   hours  I couldn t do it  As soon as I take it off I am instantly better  not really worth it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I got this item within a few days of my purchase  It is exactly what I wanted    I look a whole size smaller  instantly  I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love  but they were asking almost      for it  I highly recommend this item and the seller  Great product  great seller </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I think the concept is great but with this particular product  they have these sections that are thicker rubber  or whatever the material is  and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down  I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day  It would ve been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren t very flexible  Painful Experience</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture  It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down  I ve been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone  Of course  you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money  Great Product </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>After trying three different sizes I still couldn t find one that fit  I first ordered a medium and it wouldn t even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big  my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge  wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it  The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced     there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper  poor fit</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>When I received this  not only was it way too small for me  the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging  It was unbearable  sort of like a burnt rubber smell  There s no way I would recommend this to anyone  There are definitely other products on the market that do the job   Not recommended </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The product did what it was  supposed to  which was to give me a waist  but it kind of just redistributed my fat  My waist was super tiny  but above and below  mostly below  I bulged like crazy  so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned  My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod  so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be    I guess this product worked for other ladies  but for me  it just looked really unnatural and odd  Gave me a waist  but just pushed my fat around</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging  with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn   The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material  All three were advertized as  New  on Amazon site  Before you decide to buy new item  beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn  if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover   These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as  New  Advertized as  New  but arrives worn out</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have one of those  spare tire  waists  but when I put this on  I had an hourglass shape    I ve never had results like this with any other shapewear    But it does come with some side effects   Wore it to work for   hours  took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color  i m black  and had lines  which turned to bruises  on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting    I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline  so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable  That experience did  however  give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don t have to depend on anything to  make  me look trimmer    Great results  with some side effects   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Typically I wear a medium adult women s sized shirt and a large in juniors  and I have pesky love handles thanks to my   beautiful babies    This really works  well too  sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want need The one thing that makes it not have   stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle  if you have some curve to you  and I m not sure how to get it stretched out again However  overall  if it didn t bunch up  I would give it   stars    Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ve been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years  I purchased a new one recently and it s not the same type of material of the previous ones i ve brought  I thought maybe because i had lost weight  so i brought a smaller sizer  but that one didn t fit the same either  I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon  but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down    Upset</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>When I first received this product I was plenty happy  I thought I had finally  after   years of switching from cincher to cincher  found the right one  It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to  right sized  eating  whereas a lot of times I would get seconds  I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving   which of course is wonderful  I didn t mind that sometimes it bunched up  I didn t mind that sometimes it left welts  that went away shortly after I removed the cincher   however  after about two weeks  on of the metal prongs came out  making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn t hold it s form  Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost  Falling apart</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am     lbs  but after   kids  a set of twins  the tummy was not the same  squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes   never look better  the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat  after its off all the bulge comes out  It makes you look great thou   don t leave home without it  ahi</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it s really difficult to put on  You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the    some odd hooks  Incrediby difficult to put on</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small   Very uncomfortable I returned it  Squeem</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I had to exchange the size but the small is still  really small   It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium  I am a size   with a belly left over from a    pound weight loss  It s tedious to put on and I m exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked  There has to be an easier way  The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while  I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind  The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little  Should you buy it  If you are tolerant of the ins and outs  then go for it  It was inexpensive  A bit uncomfortable   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me  with no problem  I love that you can t see it under clothes  I notice my back feel better with it on  my posture improves  and I look good in my clothes  I love this  This is the one</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Does the job and I feel the tightness  Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me  I would recommed others to buy it  really love it </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>All and all this is a very nice product  It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing  It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours  The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture although not totally  away from your skin  Now mind you it is pure rubber  yes I said rubber  so make sure you wash it thoroughly  also it will take two days to air dry I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon      much cheaper than a boutique Cher  Wow </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions  trying a large  medium and small as my size changed after having twins  Unfortunately  I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on  I don t know why I kept trying aside from desperation  It just gave me a very weird shape  Sure  it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top  I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my  excess  down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse  I m giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it s just my body type that is the problem  I have a long torso at      and    lbs  Great product in concept but didn t work at all for me  Not the shape I was going for    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This product does suck you in Great    But the bones in here tore back back up  I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day  they need to make one smooth with out the bones  Bones</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>After   c sections  I need all the help I can get  I started with the size Large  when I was a size      I have moved on to the medium  I am between      now   The medium is REALLY tight  but does the job  I prefer the large day to day because I have   children under   to run after  and it is a bit more comfortable for that  These things are really great  I can t believe I didn t know about them after my first   c sections  They should send all women home with them after giving birth  Magic</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress  Unfortunately  they shipped the WRONG thing  and now I am stuck with a big  bulky and hideous vest  It has very ugly racerback straps  and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress  And the worst part  I m out the money  I can t even return it for a refund  even though I haven t opened the box  VERY disappointed in this company  Buyer beware  Wrong item shipped     </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit  Update  I ordered a Large and wore it for   days and it stretched too much  I am not sure this will help  but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large  I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and or hips  Sizing is Ridiculous</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ordered a  X  because that s the size that the website said to order  it came and lacked about   inches closing    so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a  x   seemed extreme  but I exchanged it I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange  I ll say that    However  when the  X arrived  it s so big it just gaps and falls off  So  was the  X mislabeled  or is this  x mislabeled  I m needing something with some firm support for post surgery care    so I really don t know what to do at this point  So what is the sizing </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This corset makes me Sweat like a hog  I am not I m a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach  Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape  was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it  because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable  hot and sweaty underneath  This was bad for my skin too  it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods  It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I d want to take it off immediately  so I never wore it  and just gave up and returned it  Still looking for a perfect corset  this however is NOT it  Don t waste your time  Causes sweat that makes it unwearable </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery  I immediately put it on  It does take some muscle power  but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on  It sucks  tucks and hold      My S O was giving me the side eye  he didnt get my excitement   this was just another one of my many purchases  BUT    But ladies and gentlemen    for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love   when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed  WOW   it does take off a few inches of the waist    I love it  I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems  Well it does force you to sit upright  Which is great   small waist and fabulous posture   I can t complain  I am loving my squeem                  best money I ever spent on shape wear</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Bought it   months after pregnancy with twins  I had gone down to my pre pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm  Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre pregnancy size after wearing it   times  works great</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Perhaps I got a bad one  A factory second  For the first     days I wore mine  it was great  just as advertised  helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist  I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture  too  although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space  However  I put it on today  and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in  the support thing  bone or whatever  under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness  My entire right front is pushing outwards on that  making a vertical bulge  whereas my left side is still firm and compressed  I don t know what could be happening  Great at first   not so good over time</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I used this product    years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape  I had a slimmer waist within weeks  You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on  It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to  but I would wear it only while working out  Otherwise  I would take it off    years later  after having my second child  I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it  I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts  It is well made and sturdy  The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising  I recommend this product  Recommend this</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable  would have been better without it  It also folds in with the fold of my stomach  which I didn t want  so it doesn t get that pooch area as well as I would ve liked  I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good  thats about it  boning is not a plus</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Sizes run really small  It flips up even though  they said it would not and the hooks don t hold  I am very dissapointed  Pass</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m training my waist to lose inches  I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to  I wear them most of the day and throughout the night  This one is more comfortable  as something squeezing u can be  and looks good under certain clothes  I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat  It speeds up the weight loss process  I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank  I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it  All in all it s a great product and the most comfortable cincher I ve ever bought  Love this </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I purchased this item to wear postpartum  I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby  The major downside to this is the poor quality  The eye portion of about five of the hook eye closures has come out entirely  I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it s only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest  Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others  to instead be a waste of my money  Poor quality</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I m a      satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear  It delivers what it promises  everything that describes the product it s true  It reduces about   inches instantly  it hardly shows with thin clothes  it doesn t let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day  It recommends to wear it about   hours but I can even sleep with it  the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks  it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows  and it s the perfect length for my core I m      I tried another brand before but it was too long for me  I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down  I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand Once I get used to this one  I m planning to order the  Extra firm compression   It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more  Squeem Perfect Waist  Firm compression</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This would be great if it had boning in it  I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure  but when I put it on  the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist  forming a bulge above and below my waist  Too bad  I had hoped this would work based on reviews  Not the best shaper</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My size medium was true to size  This made my waist smaller and while I had it on  I didn t eat as much because of the pressure  it makes me feel full  however  all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose  I did like the fact that it s shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy    BUTTT    a HUGE BUT for me    What I didn t like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back  eewww      and I don t even have back fat    So to me this defeats the whole purpose  All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat    Also  what s going on with the price increase   I just bought this   weeks ago for      now it s      It works  BUT    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I like it because it came as I was expecting that   and really helped to save money compare to other stores squeem</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely  The problem is that after only   day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair  I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching  This didn t help the bent supports and I returned the product  Product defective after   day of use</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>after baby    I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible  I am so glad that I bought the squeem  it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape  I began wearing mine   week postpartum and people just couldn t believe that I had just had a baby  Now that I am   months postpartum  I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support  It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before  a great buy </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it      But this waist cincher is not for me  I m not gonna say don t buy it because alot of women are shaped different I just got it yesterday and I m sending it back  It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all  So if you know you have more than enough back fat  this is not for you  I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help  I wear a size medium  so its my correct size  But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me  The vest covers all the back fat and everything  But I still give Squeem thumbs up though        No No No This is not for me     </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I recently purchased the Power Cotton   Rubber Waist Cincher  and loved it so much I thought I d give this one a try as well  As far as the smell  it s very faint  Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly  The fit was nice   comfortable  But it s not a solid black like you d assume  Prepare for a charcoal black gray color for the exterior  The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies  so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day  The same thing with the waist cincher  the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days Overall  great product  Can t Go Wrong With This Item </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust  I am a short woman and it doesn t reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back  It takes me in great  love that about it but because it isn t long enough I can t wear it anywhere   Would be great but   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff   the boning and the hooks showed through  so could not even wear it inside a tshirt  Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it works but uncomfortable</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this product based on the positive reviews  I wish I hadn t bought this waist cincher  The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle  which goes about   inches on my thigh  the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly  it is extremely visible under a normal t shirt  and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it  This looks decent  barely  when you re standing up  and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down  The length is way off  it goes   inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits  I m     and weight     lbs  This looks terrible and I m sending it back the same day it was delivered  Save your money  Major let down </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth   months ago and i m still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that    really i recomended  Money well spend it Awsome  </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth   That worked well  but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this  This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip      Wasnt worth</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I had two reasons for the purchase of this product  one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago   the other was pure vanity  But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons  It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful    I just cannot express in words how great this product is    GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship  And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive  Not too happy with their customer service  Not so much</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit  Warning  you cannot return for a refund  only merchandise credit exchange  Also  the cincher smelled like burnt rubber  Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing  Burn Rubber on Me</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress  First  it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing  Second  it did almost nothing to slim me down  even though I bought the suggested size  Third  after about a half hour of wearing it  it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable  It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in  and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress  I abandoned it completely and felt much better  Not worth the price   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too tight wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby  couldn t even close the whole thing Returned it ASAP Torture</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The product states that inches will be removed after    days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least    hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference For the price of the item  it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply  Squeem</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box  Like some have said  takes a few minutes to get used to it  I ve been wearing it for   hours now and I just love it  It covers everything that needs to be covered  and I am long waisted   It stays put  which I love  It s comfortable  It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach  pooch   It s comfortable enough to sit in  Best of all  instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support  I m looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future  I wonder if I can wear it on my runs  Hmmm    Also  I have a size    inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops  Just take your measurements before you order  Hopefully  as I lose weight  from my running training program  I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it  Well    then I ll just have to get a size small  I love it  I m very impressed so far</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I was really excited to try this  however it is not for everyone  I have a  flat  stomach just flabby and then I have  love handles  so I thought this would just hold everything in but that s not how it worked for me  It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn t have before  It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front  I think I would rather have the love handles  I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts   Not exactly why I bought it but o well   I still gave it   stars because it is still working for me  just not how I thought it would  Not for everyone</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I first ordered size X L  but that was too big  so I returned it and bought a L  The first couple of wearings were difficult  but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body  I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it  sort of like the top part of panty hose   I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around  It is not comfortable to wear while sitting  For me  I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter  as I think my torso is shorter than most  I do think it is helping  but I need to wear it for more hours  I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep  rather than in the daytime  but I have not tried that yet  The product is well made  Squeem   A Combination of Scream and Squeeze </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This product does what is said in the description  my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back  My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back  I love it  Is my second buy  The price is also good  the first one I got cost me     this time I paid     for it  excelent product </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes  It is hard to bend over  especially as a school teacher  I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke s Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear  Hard to put on</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This product sucks It doesn t completely suck    the   days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight  As many people have noted  it is HELL to get into this the first time I liked that this wasn t a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up BUTThis garment    Rides up  if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist   Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist   and it hurts   Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down  visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice  first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side  ouch    RETURNING THIS    Why does everybody rave when    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It was really easy to put the Squeem on  but once it was on I couldn t wait to get it off   It wasn t too tight or anything  The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip mid back area and pinched my skin  It was so painful  No matter how I positioned it  it would bunch up  Really disappointed since it was a waste of       Uncomfortable </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This shape wear is the best I ve had until now regarding easiness to wear and put on  It does a great job at keeping the post pregnancy flabby belly under control  However  after about   months of daily use  the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric  It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out  I wish there was a better designed support for this binder  Otherwise  it is awesome   good looking for such lingerie  So  if you buy it  expect   months of wearing it without problems    Great idea  poor design</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought   for friends loveit best

time for me</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven t been able to do in a while because of my weight gain I am a woman who has size   D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size   in pants  and weight    lbs  It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure  Well  it did hug my waist  but it also gave my a muffin top  Not a shape a woman wants to have  I looked better without wearing it  It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body  I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts   no hips  or ass  Not for a woman who has large breast  hips  and ass  Not for women who are going through post pregnancy either  For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself  it failed  Not OK   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in  However  I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound  Not worth the pain  Not worth the pain it causes</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area  my grandmother even notice it  and she didn t even know i bought it  It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body  I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium  I love It </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I think this is a case of my expectations being too high  I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product  I really was expecting a miracle  After only wearing this twice  it is stretched out  At first  I thought perhaps it would regain it s shape after a few hours but nope  It s no better than a cheap  fashion corset  It will smooth things out so there s less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real  waist trainer   something that would go on tight and STAY tight  Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for  waist trainer   I would say the claims of this product are misleading  It is shapewear  it is NOT a  cincher  or a  trainer   disappointed</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I washed it before used it for the first time  The next day I wore it  I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach  And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that  itchy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>i realy love my shape wear  i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she s notice a big difference  i love it  </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have been using this for   weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements  my posture is definitely improved  I have also lost about   pounds  which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise  but I have also been wearing the corset at least   days a week for up to   hours at a time I am          pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should  super tight  I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks My only complaint is the SMELL  It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices  I notice  I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it  but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin Otherwise  the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time  Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes    Wow  Ow and What s that smell </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>i have a       inch waist normally  should ve started with a size Small  the XS seemed a bit smaller than described  definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist  squeem is pretty good</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great product for giving you that snug fit   it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long  I really do like this item  the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing   so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt  because everyone will know your secret  Snug Fit</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Squeem is a great idea  but their quality is second rate  and their customer service is worse than useless  I d owned mine for about   weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched  The threads aren t frayed  they re unstitching from the seam Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility  They ve asked for pictures of the damage  and then failed to respond to the pictures  or any further attempts to contact them For what this costs  it needs to last longer than   weeks  Poor quality and lousy customer service</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hello  I am a woman nearing my   s  and my waist certainly isn t getting any smaller  I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever growing belly  To accommodate for my girth  I bought the Squeem  Magical  Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX Large  the largest size available  WELL  here s a bit of magic for ya  sisters  The second I snapped the first two hooks together  the tightness was unbearable  It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass  Fortunately  the discomfort didn t last long  since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether  These things need to come in larger sizes  Not even worthy of   star  More worthy of steaming diarrhea  IN THE TRASH IT GOES     </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have  The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new  It must be washed before wearing  The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat  But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening  The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it s good for the back as well as the front  Very sturdy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I liked how it pulled everything in  I felt fantastic for about   hours  it really flattens the tummy area  which is all I really want  but you can see the hooks threw clothes    I felt like that ruined it for me  also I had to keep pulling it up  It bunches in the back  and really smells like rubber  After about   or   days one of the  bones  on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side  it really hurt  I would not recommend this product  Worked for   days then broke</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly hope i could buy it in beige color  could be little cheaper does its job</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Love this product  I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss  It is true to size  Squeem</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I ve only worn this for a day so far  but I love it  I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son   months ago  This really holds you in  its comfortable and I don t think it shows through your clothes  I highly recommend   So Far So Good </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I love how this product makes me look in my clothes    its shapes me into a perfect hourglass  i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after    days is true because i havent had it that long  my only complaints are that it is a little too short  so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me  but overall  it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased  i love it and would recommend it to anyone  Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn t have big expectations for it at all  I figured I d wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape  I ve been wearing it for a month already and I ve seen my waist go down   inches  I wear it all day at work from      till about       It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small  I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore   hence the   star rating   I m very happy with this product for the price  It works better than Spanx  simple quick fix</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses  It also offers great support for your back  It is perfect for everyday wear  A must have   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream   i would say if you get this product it s best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn t damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I ll get two of them The squeem waist cincher</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It didn t do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top  making your breasts and back look MUCH wider  If I do continue to wear it  it will be around the house or under loose clothes jackets  Wasn t that impressed        </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I really liked the Squeem  I m a petite person  but have some love handles that I need to hide when I m wearing tight clothes  The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it s tight  Squeeeeeze into your clothes</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This works really well  I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at   months post partum  It s still a bit separated but this definitely helped  I wish I knew about it sooner  It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it  Great to wear during exercise  again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward  Also  it looks hot  And sometimes I wear it out  I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time  Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur      waist before pregnancy      waist when I bought a size medium      now  and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted    Love it</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I read the reviews for this product and purchased  I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake  I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably  For me if I don t feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don t feel it s working  The thing I like the most about it is that s it s strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top  Body hugging tops excluded  of course  I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town  Good product</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn t work as described on the advert  I ve never been so sore  both side  in my entire life  I cannot wear it for more than  h  Other then the product itself  the delivery system was also misleading I choose a     days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later  What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didn t use correct stamp or pay the full charge     Waste of money</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>the first day     hours wearing it   it hurt me so bad   my skin was torned  itched  swell  deep red  I tried to wear other side  after few hours  I got deep burned both on the right and left belly  the

size chart on the box size small is for waistline      my waist is    so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp maybe it s just me but i am terribly disappointed does not fit me </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I read up on belly wrapping after my c section and bought a couple compression tank tops from Wal Mart  which worked nicely  I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews  When I received it and tried it on  it felt disgusting on my skin  It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable  even without a super tight or thin shirt on   especially when I sat down  The seams and the boning are all very noticeable  and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way  like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty  I have wore corsets for years  and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body  I returned it immediately  Bulky  feels gross  not worth ordering</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site  Now

want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy  Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits  Works great and like they say pain is beauty  and this is so worth it  perfect</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing  trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone  AMAZING</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>It really works  I am in love  I was trying to get my pre pregnancy    in waist back for    months now  I got to   in and kind of got stuck there  With Squeem I went from    in waist to   in in just   minutes  Start hooking it from the top  much easier  Buy it  You won t regret  Its amazing   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It s pretty awesome for such a price  It definitely gives you great posture  I was sitting up straight like no other  although i wish they could

are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways  First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark  Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them  After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them  They also seemed to chip very easily  So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn t take looking at them anymore  They also are not good in the microwave  They get very hot and the food not so much  I would not recommend for everyday use  Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable  My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain  I will never buy these again  Dont order them in white or any light color</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous  I

scholarly book  Great detail and very in depth analysis  Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy  not just Islam  That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises  for most of its adherents  Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life  dictating every aspect of it  Unavoidably  there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions  Prof  Kuran delves into the history of these movements  but he does more than that  he puts all this in cultural and political context  At the end  he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it  Writing is very formal  not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic  but it was well worth it for this reader  Religion and profits</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Ten

transparent they could be ghosts The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner  This is the last book I read by this author  One can only rest on his laurels for so long  I m glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review  WARNING  This is the worst book ever written</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr  Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market It s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public All along  I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself Yet  once I overcame my frustration and finished the book  I regretted not heeding to my senses It s obvious that Mr  Higgins had no heart in writing this book  and he made no effort in showing creativity with words I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases  e g   browning with carswell silencer  over and over again in every single chapter  This book made me a true anti Higgins     Edge of Danger</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>  star   only because that s the minimum This book proves the famous can publish anything  Edge of Danger</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is my very first book review  Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up  The main character Sean Dillion  formal IRA  has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice  He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary  He pickup a couple of his terrorism criminal partners making killing like a habits  terrorism competition  fun game and egoism fulfillment  It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity  The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence  This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value  I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion s serial after finishing this ridicules book  Actually  this book is not worth one star </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It s a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters   Sean Dillon and his     in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it s just a bore The action isn t believable  The plot is silly  The dialogue is written to tell the reader what s going on  and every character speaks with the same voice    this isn t how real people speak  Then the characters overexplain because  apparently  the author wasn t paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago Frankly  I ve read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days  It just isn t worth it anymore  Jack  Too much work reading for too little reward  Not Worth The Reader s Time</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations  The action is thin as well  characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail  Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax  Disappointing and too simplistic</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is simply the worst book I remember reading  I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels  so I happily picked this up  I m sorry I did  It is nothing but action  which might be OK for a fun read on the beach  but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous  Massive action scenes  such as large battles  take place in only   or   pages  There s no character development  poor dialogue  no setting descriptions  no drama or suspense    nothing but a poorly described series of  events   Enough said  Worst Book I ve Ever Read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I have been a Higgins fan for many years  and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written  Some were great and full of suspense  But the last three he has written  including this one   Edge of Danger   are very disappointing  He has resorted to producing   books a year  based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth  predictable characters  and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer Count the number of Marlboros smoked  the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank   and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another   and you find a shallow book  I would save my money on this one  and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions  hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector  Formula Writing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book  I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story   or like the outline of a book  It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue   no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people  It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed  I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book  I am very disappointed   just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels  I have never read another book of his either  Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Where did the real Jack Higgins go  This is not only Higgin s worst effort to date  it is probably the worst book I ve read in the past   years   Can you say  lazy   Jack  I can t believe I actually finished it  and one star is a generous rating  Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter  no character or plot development  written like a  th grader The end of the book foretells a sequel   a book that I will immediately pass on  Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first Don t buy it    don t borrow it    don t read it  Worst of theYear   or  maybe the decade</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>After reading this book  I felt guilty for having purchased it  because that contributed to its best seller status   Oops  maybe not  the way it works now  it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores   But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher s attention for their worthy efforts  while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status  Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler  Writing on autopilot</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Having read only one other Higgins book before  Cold Harbor   I hesitate  somewhat  to comment on the author s general talent  However  this book has to be one of the worst I ve read in some time  I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog  unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic   Damn  he said to Kate   It s the Hazar Scouts    Puhleeze  Not even an exclamation mark  Many other examples could be given  Now  assuming for the moment that the dialog was  say  written at greater than a  th grade level  the plot is almost as bad  The protagonists  reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one by one is almost comic  There s no depth here  just one simple vignette after another  I wouldn t even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy  although Clancy s gotten a bit rough of late  A terrific waste of a good Sophomoric at Best</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination  If I hadn t bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it  A Waste of Time</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author  I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British  His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires The action is non stop and pretty interestng  It s a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth  Plenty of action</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very simplistic writing style  he said  she said  then he said  then she said  This reads like a first attempt  not like a book written by a seasoned author of over    books  Good story  Poor writing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ve never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger  I ve enjoyed Mr  Higgins  books in the past but can t for the life of me understand a  why he wrote this book  or b  why it was published  There is no plot  no character development  predictable action  no tension  It s like reading an Executive Summary of a book  Are you sure they didn t publish the outline by mistake  Do I have to give it   star </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I m so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel  If it were  it would also be my last Normally  I can forgive Higgins his cliche s and his obsessive attention to his characters  drinking habits  because his characters are fun and interesting  He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them  and you can t wait to find the next book especially if it s got Sean Dillon But not this one  All the characters are wooden  The action is colorless and completely unbelievable  A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog  A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else There is no sense of timing or place  only the thinnest of motivations for most characters  and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters This book is amateur hour  Don t bother  Read some of Higgins s earlier works instead  Disappointment on every page</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Boy  this was a disappointing read  The characters were not well developed  hence challenging to keep track of   the plot was implausible yet predictable  and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book  I did  although it was unrewarding to do so I d rate this lower if I could FYI  if you re looking for an alternate selection in the same genre  I highly recommend Silent Joe by T  Jefferson Parker  I would rather watch paint dry</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons  fine dining  glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development  Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers  And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another    sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes    strains credulity Higgins has done some first rate work  Had this been published twenty five years ago  this might have made a difference  It wasn t and it doesn t  Tired formula</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is by far his worst effort that I ve read  He s not my favorite spy author anyway  This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher s contract or obligation that Mr  Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry  The characters are not at all fleshed out  and the story line is too contrived  I would advise not wasting time by reading this book  This is not the Jack Higgins I know</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Up to now  I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books  although they have tended to become more samey  I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger  The tired old characters of Dillon  Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable  highly contrived and unbelievable yarn  The plots have all been used before  and if you ve read any two other Dillon books you ll be able to guess the next line throughout  I bought it to read on the plane   was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding  Give this one a miss  Completely predictable</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book has no plot  and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing  Sean Dillon s character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening  A very poorly written book  The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it  Mr  Higgins  it s time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than   weeks on writing a book   EXTREMELY SHALLOW</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently  but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further  His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible  pointless heritage  But  what do you expect from a middle aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket     depth  Cartoon Arab Scottish Villain</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Given the lack of character development  or rather  simplistic and at times contradictory character development  the lack of any plot whatsoever  and poor visualizations  I can t believe I read the whole book  I guess I kept waiting for the action to start  It never did  Can t believe I read the whole thing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Very few books contain their own review  This one does  Stone said   It really is like a bad movie  Harry    You can bleeding well say that again         This book reads like a  th grade reading level condensation of an outline of a screenplay  The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long  very few words greater than two syllables are used  No complex thoughts  no character development  no suspense  and little description  Pure formulaic twaddle  I d rate it   stars if I could have   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The plot is not believable  there is not a shred of character development  and there isn t even any descriptive atmosphere  It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel  I shall not buy any more of his efforts  A bad book  poorly written </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is without a doubt Higgins  least inspired work in years  The plot is predictable and over worn  and the books is very uninspired  A real disappointment higgins disappoints</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor s deadline  There was no character development  Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense  I ve never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again  Poorly Written</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger  The writing is just plain shallow  the plot predictable  Save your money for something better  A Disappointment</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last  Especially if  as the reviews state  it is the best Higgins book in a long time The characters are never developed  The way the book begins  you think that the Rashid s are the good guys  and Dillin is the bad guy  Then all the sudden  without developing the characters  the roles are switched  You end up not caring who dies  and   billion people die in this book   a little overkill  and who lives The  adventures  are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are  They are very predictable  and of course  Dillin is killing    people and no one can kill him  Just ridiculous scenes Don t get this book  despite the  reliablity  of the author  Horrible</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on going saga of Dillon  Ferguson and Bernstein  If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins  then you might like Edge of Danger  because it is more of the same   However  if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins  efforts  then you probably want to take a pass on this  and for me at least  future efforts as well   Higgins  books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels  Dialog between the characters  which often is terse  choppy  and unimaginative  makes up virtually all of the text  Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text  As with the last few books from Higgins  Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment  Not worth the effort</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A terrible  childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature  Higgins loves to  speak Irish  but even that gambit fails in this trite  poorly plotted  worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can t do any better than such trashy writing  Can t believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I purchased this book expecting very good things  I found the plot very thin and predictable  There was very little suspense  It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out  Also there didn t seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded  and on the surface stupid  behaviour  Disappointing and thin</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I don t know who is worse  Higgins or Macnee  The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next  Completely implausible  Macnee s narration is so overdone it is laughable  Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky  A real stinker  Wayne Schwartz  Los Angeles  CA Two Hacks</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not      true  but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing  For an example I have these questions Q  How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody  the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance A  I don t know if the mob knows it but at least four times Q  Why the target man  who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him A  Because the target man likes to be in danger Q  When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn t he A  Because something in his head didn t let him even if he had killed many men before And as the energizer rabbit  I can keep going and going and going  my advise is to skip this book  Just skip it</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I bought this CD for one song only

very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said  The Scarlett Letter</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hawthorne s use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable  yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points  He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax  The climax es  happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book  Read Atlas Shrugged  Anthem  or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment  A thorn in the side of literature </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I read this book during a high school vacation  Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy  the mystery involved in the story captivated me  As the story developed  I realized the profound intricacy of the plot  The conclusion of the story was not happy  nor did it even seem fair  As one who knows Hawthorne s puritan morality standards  however  I say that he communicated his message extremely well  A Moral Novel with a Mystery</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I read this book for my   th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock  Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul  This book does much more than that  It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy  He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly  He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture  He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim  All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone  Excellent Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left  Most auto systems have that

honestly say  it is the single most boring book I ve EVER read  You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story  It has no action  No suspense  It isn t deep  Things don t symbolize anything  If they do  then you re thinking too hard  This book is not a classic  It is the worst  I d recommend copying a dictionary before I d ask you to read this pile  DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS  Oh

boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought  The only reason that I didn t give this book   star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism  WAY OVERRATED  Absolute Waste of Time</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I hate Hawthorne s style of writing  It s over bloated and self indulgent  I wish he d just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on  The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera  All of the characters are one dimensional  I m not going to say the book is poorly written  but it s written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read  Overall  a disappointment  A Tedious Read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I will never understand how  Classics  become Classics  So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics  Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom   Hawthorne creates an ok tale  but really  It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic  Then he throws Pearl in there  she is like some super human and belongs in fantasy  I never really did believe in the whole  they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything   That is just a bit hypocritical  either she was excepted as prat of the society  which she was not  or she wasn t  which she almost was  See that just doesn t make any sense  The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was  but it doesn t  It is better than Dickens  but then again everything is  Classic  Really </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlet Letter  for me was just a little boring  Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it  Also sometimes it got confusing

the genre  I am  of course  a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well  One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral  or pink  than scarlet or red  Also  the back cover is white  and I am most definitely one for appearances  I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover  Nonetheless  the binding will look fair on my bookshelf  Over all the book was clean and well taken care of  and was shipped to me with great haste  A Good Buy  Great Condition  Almost Exactly What I Expected</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This novel is an Opera  pure and simple Granted it is not the easiest novel to read  and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors  similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines  Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot Nonetheless  the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic  The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his her sins  and how honesty  for some  comes at the price of great shame The novel does take patience  but it moves along at a very neat pace  Had the novel been written with more scenes  and less exposition  it could have been even more gripping I read the Reader s Digest edition  which comes with about    lovely illustrations  which capture the essence and the mood of the novel  So that was nice eye candy Look out for the last three chapters   talk about a fall to the floor  clutching at the heart climax  it s all here  Breathtaking Enjoy  Gripping</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne  It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle    The character portrayals are superb  It analyses the thoughts  motivations  strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story   Hester Prynn  the vengeful doctor  the hapless minister and Hester s vivacious and elf like daughter Pearl  The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society  is especially moving  While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid  most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study  though at times it s little slow Overall  a well crafted story and a good read The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents  I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price  Luckily  it s free  Good read  but hard to navigate ebook</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A friend of mine called this book ponderous  she read it in  th grade  Go back to this

This book is about a woman who has an affair  choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover s identity  Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter  a delightfully and hillariously strange

read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english   class  I found that the author was too verbose in describing people  places  situations  and just the story in general  The book was so wordy  I often

it takes him AGES to get his point across  Bad Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I teach high school English  and was required to teach thisto my students  I don t know who suffered more  me or them To be fair  as one of America s first novels  it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job On the other hand  it is excruciating to read  There is nosuspense  little to sympathize or

half the length  I don t reccommend  I must say</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along  i tried to follow along  but too boaring

and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed  Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non fictional books about the Puritan settlers  This book was a pill  There are so many American authors  and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story  Two thumbs down  Historically accurate it may be  but a boring read

now  once in high school and now again in my    s  it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written  It was difficult read but the more I got into the book  the easier it became  The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving  I plan to read it again in my    s and I know I will see it in a completely different light  I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes  Worth the effort</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td> Easy A  explains it best  If you can t relate in some way you must be a robot  Greatest book ever  Puritanical ostracism</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel  Throughout the novel  only   major events occur  one in the beginning  one in the middle  and one at the end  The characters are flat and difficult to relate to  Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than    pages or so  Hawthorne s writing is totally ridiculous  He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery  These pages consist of long paragraphs  some which encompass multiple pages  If I didn t have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own  I m not saying that it is a difficult novel  but it is an unpleasant one  In the end  if you are looking to read great American novels  skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain  Wasted Time</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Beautifully descriptive  tragic story  Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion  Good

respect for your own time whatsoever  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK    Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it  it will cease to be a so called classic  First of all  it is written in pretty difficult language  That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort  but this one definitely is not  The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong  I believe  and poorly conveyed  The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive  but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re read The Scarlet Letter  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library  It s a classic  must own for anybody that values the concept of reading  And if

you after a while  The book is filled with antiquated language  and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery  I was forced to read this book for my English class

out there  read it  It induces sleep in minutes  ZzZzZzZzZzZz      Terrible book  do not read it </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I stongly dislike this book  There is too much meaninglessness to it  I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph   it s awful  Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary  I have understood two chapters  I don t see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences  It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering  As I stated before  this is not my kind of book  Meaningless Drivel</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It is my invariably correct opinion that the so called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged

much attention as being  one of the best novels ever   It s very short  and very boring  It s written in old english  which adds to the difficulty  and even if you can understand it  you finish the book and say   Ok  so what s the point   There is absolutely no point to this novel  Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text  and the description is so vague that you can t even tell what a character is doing half the time  Who Chooses Classics </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This novel was the most boring book I have ever read  I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance  Even though there is much symbolism to be found  when is one supposed to find it  while they are sleeping  Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece  How did this book become a  CLASSIC    Hallelujah   is what I said when I finished this book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Everyone needs to read this classic  An amazing look into the piousness of the early settlers  I really appreciated it a lot  a must read</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Any Hawthorne work  including this one  shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature  As to subject matter  kids are more receptive to the likes of  The House of the Seven Gables   Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn t been forcefed  The Scarlet Letter   complete with the Customs House filler  in high school  Lest the reader find this teacher cynical  note the five stars   I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne   Teachers  This is not his best novel</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I am an avid reader  specially of books in the English language  The movie  The Scarlet Letter  has been a favorite of mine  but reading other reviews of the novel  other editions  here in Amazon  prompted me to read it  People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa  people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne s   th century language  But I could deal perfectly with the idiom  even though it s not my first language  Both the movie and the novel are excellent  although different  Very good and very unlike the movie</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It s hard to put together any nice words about this transcription  It is not kindle ready  although it is textually complete  Should be a freebie  not kindle ready</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>this book seemed to take awhile to get to me but it still came within the specified time frame so  all s well I guess  and the condition of the book was quite acceptable  good</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book may have been one of the best books of the   th century but its language and themes don t relate to us very much any more  The Scarlet Letter is very boring and never seems to end  I really disliked the book  Boring  very</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My english teacher assigned this book  one I would never read on my own  I am a    year old and I enjoy reading  But this book  while it does have a few good points and messages  is incredibly dull  The points are hard to get and I only understood the points after we had discussed them in class  While this book has a rather good story it s concealed by endless symbols and references  I suggest the cliff notes version   Boring</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is another classic out in the book world but I find it extremely hard to follow  Hawthorne had a lot of good points in the book but I didn t understand them until they were pointed out to me  If you don t get into that Puritan time period of literature then I suggest you don t read it  There is a lot of symbolism in this book  too  Really Hard to Follow</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Of course this is a classic of American literature  and  to my mind  with good reason  The story engages and puts one in the time  It requires a modern reader to stretch  but the exercise rewards  A fascinating look into another time s mores</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call  Old English   use the much cliched Olde if you must  to  New English   And trust me  it shows  Virtually every book ever written during this period   essentially  before Twain s Huckleberry Finn   bears the same markings   incredibly lavish diction  complex structure and syntax  and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel  If you elevate your reading to that next level  where you re seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne s masterful use of symbolism and metaphor  and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late     s  then you ll consider this book a worthwhile read  One word  outdated</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is a good but long and discriptive book  I wouldn t tell anybody to read it unless they classic books or a Hawthorne fan  This book and also The House of The Seven Gables are based on the one unlying rule of Hawthorne description  His books wouldn t be so long if he would have just gotton to the plot  Now don t get me wrong the plot to this book was good but the movie is even better  If you have to read it just deal with it  All I know is that is didn t hold my attenion very long and I fell asleep a couple of times  I was fored to read it too</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is a tragedy in two ways  Everyone dies at the end  and if you have to or choose to read this you will experience a tragedy I can compare this book to a lobster People say lobsters are a delecacy and you have to get through a shell to get to the meat This book is a  classic  and you have dissect each and every sentence to get a general understanding Avoid this book at all costs  if you have to read it in school then you are better off faking a concusion  a tragedy</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I find the old english wording too hard to understand and too hard to read   haven t got into it too far yet but it is taking me forever to get here too had to read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I had to read this book for my high school English class  I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it  This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads  As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading  This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life   How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it   star much less    This should be rated in negative stars  Simply the worse book ever </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My rating is only for the electronic formatting of this book  I really feel like I don t have any right to complain since the book was free but  you get what you pay for The book starts with an introduction to the story which goes on for     of the book file  The actual text of the book doesn t start until location         Unfortunately the only way to find this is to page through from the beginning  It would have been nice to have a table of contents or at least a bookmaark for the start of the actual book  No Active Table of Contents</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>To me this book would turn a young person  like my self away from the key and enjoyment of reading   Being a book with extensive mistakes in it  it is very difficult to read unless you are to inerpret it every paragraph or should I say sentence  I t maybe a classic  but I feel that the word  classic  comes from just being old                                                                                                        p s the only reason I put a star was because I had to  to express my opinion on he novel  Should not be a requirement in high school</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book is like a bad soap  No action  No drama  Very predictable  It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man  The baby dad is the preacher  Why the couple couldn t have gotten a divorce is beyond me  And the writing is horrible  Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it  Reading this is like a punch in the testicles   it HURT    This book is hell on earth  Don t read it  By the way  I had to give it one star  It was like a bad dream  but I couldn t wake up</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I guess I should have read the last review or even the fact that the description says Landscape  I didn t think it was necessary  it s just a book right I guess it s supposed to be easier to read in bed  I just thought it would be cool to have the Scarlet Letter be a red book If you buy this book you will be holding the book like a wall calendar and reading in two columns  first the two columns on the top page and then two columns on the bottom  This just seems really irritating to me  Landscape book</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO  THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK  I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD  THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY  HOWEVER  THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO  THE SIMPLE CONCEPT OF SIN  TABOO</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>My    year daughter was delighted to receive the Scarlet Letter  She has enjoyed reading it through out X mas vacation  I had forgotten how good literature can be an excellent gift  Excellent gift</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>For a first time reading of this classic I recommend this  If you love it you may want a nicer version for the bookshelf  This is a nice quality book though  The printing isn t too small  and neither is the book  It fits right in my paperback bookshelf perfectly with others just like it And as for the story  I could go on many pages  Just do a few searches for reviews  it s a classic that will outlive all of us and has a lot to say about human beings and our culture  past and future One of the best Classics  great one to get started on or to read over and over again  Great classic for the price</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house  We  looked inside this book  on line and it shows that it includes the custom house  When the book arrived  it did not include the custom house  Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class  Missing Custom House</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I absolutely loved this book  it was so engrossing  could not put it down  Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions  it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive  A flawless book  Incredibly engrossing</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is overloaded with many superfluous words that requires the reader to sift through them all to get to the actual story  However  the strong characters are revealed through their actions more than through Hawthorne s descriptions  The story takes place in   th Century Boston and Puritanical Law is heavily enforced  A young woman  Hester  has been imprisoned for getting pregnant while committing adultery  Now that the baby is   months old  they have her stand in the center of town with so she can be shamed by the whole town  Her husband just happens to come to town as she stands on the scaffold and thus the story continues in a dark spiral of hidden friendships  revenge  immense guilt  and sin  This story is a historical fiction told     years later and is full of symbolism and the ironies of human nature and society  The ending was rather abrupt as if Hawthorne was on a writing deadline and got tired of his own story  Characterization in The Scarlet Letter</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Frankly  in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us  It seems too  that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading  Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written  What I always find fascinating is that this  like most other classics  is about human nature  power and the consequences of actions  So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others  to be voyeurs which is what makes a classic a classic  the illiteracy of our generation</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Great book  had seen the movie but the book is much more  It will hold your attention and is an easy read too Even better  the e book was free on Amazon  The Scarlet Letter e Book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am an avid reader  I have read many so called  classics   This book is just plain boring  Yawn     I really tried to get into it  I couldn t finish it  I just kept falling asleep  This book contains some seriously long sentences  Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so  I couldn t do that  It just seems wrong  If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all  I am sorry to say  I have not read the Scarlet Letter   Sorry Hawthorne     I really  really tried  I just don t get it </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>loved it in high school  love it as an adult   Great book and very informative Book is written well with ability to keep the reader interested in the book and all it has too offer Characters and other plot  favorite classic</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It is a travesty that this novel is even classified with the classics  This is by far one of the most boring and pointless novels in existance  The plot dribbles on about sin and adultry with few arguments  The contrasting of light and dark  with shadows  light and color is overdone and quite childish  Any third grade student can classify purity as light and sin as darkness  More over  there is over a hundred pages of belaboring the point  with no real conclusion  At the end of the novel  all I had was a headache  and I had fallen asleep more than a dozen times  Childish Novel</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I hated this story  It was long  It was preachy  It was boring  Unless you re interested in catching up on battles with Puritanism  avoid this book  Jeff the Scorned</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue book assignment of it  The word  ugh  summarizes my experience This book was written in the   th century  and that s where it belongs  It wouldn t be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book  but reading through  dost thou  after  dost thou  isn t any fun However  I highly recommend reading Richard Armour s take on SL in his book  The Classics Reclassified   Ugh </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I know that saying the book is dumb nullifies all the hard work put into it  but I just did not like it  Sure the main idea and a well written summary makes the book as a whole good  it doesn t help the actual context one bit which was very hard to follow and comprehend  This book was dumb</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ve bought this book  underlined every hint of symbolism  found all evidence of romanticism  followed every quote involving thematic oppositions  and noted every example of Pearl s rebellious nature and social alienation  but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding  The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace  Avg  Rating too high</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ordered a specific ISBN No  and received a different tiny book of the same with different appearence and a different ISBN No The picture seen online is not the one that I received  Received a different book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This novel is absolutely awful  Although it has received over     reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs  at zero  Where to begin    perhaps with the run on sentences  the failure to create significant rising action  the flat two dimensional characters    This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader  but frustrate them as well The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant  Post modern society does not really care about   Baby daddies   and the revelation which is made at the end  and beginning  of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury  Unfortunately  Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster  Oh my   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So I heard about this from a friend at Comi Con  He did not know much about it  but heard some people talking about it in the food court  I thought it sounded awesome  like Read or Die meets a cross between The Green Lantern and The Crimson Crusader  So I order what I thought was the graphic novel  turns out it is more  novel  and less  graphic   It was nothing like I expected  and unless shame is a super power  which is unlikely  Hester is just some puritan lady before radioactive spiders even existed Seriously  I don t think  BANG    POW   or  ZORT   show up anywhere in the book  I almost gave this one star  but Roger Chillingworth is an awesome super villain name  His physiognomy is dead on as well  like in all comics  it let s us know he is the clear bad guy and we should not relate to him at all  Since the bad guy at least fits what I expect this gets   stars  Far too little crime and fist fights</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Too long  Re read this and remembered how much Hawthorne s style irritates me  There is an interesting story within but he takes WAY too long to tell it  Get to the point already</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The story is a very simple one but the action  so to speak  doesn t really happen until the final third of the book  It was a battle to get through the dry middle Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least On the plus side  the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres  Slow moving predictable story</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it  It is true that it s language can be hard to read and understand at times  but that does not make it uninteresting  The main story  may not be considered exciting  but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book  Several faults are pointed to in this  perfect  Puritain town in which the story takes place  The book uses good elements like foreshadowing  foil characters  and a lot symbolism  A main point of the book is Hester s admiting her guilt as compared to her  lover s  hiding his guilt  I m not going to tell you who she had the affair with  but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter  The book may not be as exciting as some  but don t let this keep you from reading it  because it really is good  Good book if you look into it </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Call me a sucker for classics  well I am  This novel brings forth issues that are still with us today  Yes  the book was written over     years ago  but it deals with Single mothers in a two parent society and how the outsiders to the situation  townspeople  deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter  Pearl  Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings  even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child ren  and to survive themselves  Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers  but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book  I give it five stars because of it s beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single parenthood  Great     READ ME READ ME READ ME   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I will never understand why they force this book on school children  I m sure there are many other  classic  stories that could be included in the curriculum  Horrific forced reading</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I have yet to actually complete this novel  It is so dog gone hard to understand  On top of this  I have an essay that is due  TOMORROW  Is there no relief   I read to pages of this novel and I had to stop </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I was assigned this book when I was a sophomore in high school     years ago   I couldn t get through it  the Cliff Notes version help me pass the test  I found it turgid and laborious reading I graduated in the top     of my high school class  I have a master s degree  Despite my academic success  I don t understand why this book is a classic  I don t understand why Hester didn t just pack up Pearl and her stuff  move to another town and tell everyone she was a widow  That would have saved everyone alot of grief  especially young readers like me  I don t get it </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is the worst book I have ever read  The attempts at symbolism are bogged down with unnecessary detail and the language is over the top even for the time period  I hurled it across the room at one point in agitation and disgust  I hate this book </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I got the auido book cuz I didn t have time to read the book for my english report and exam  I listen to it for one week and did a great book report and did great on the final exam  I did better listen than reading  its as if I were reading the book itself </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>My son was forced to read this book for his high school english class  I consider this cruel and unusual punishment  I believe there are some consitutional laws that prevent schools from giving kids this big slop of boring inside about     pages  Its the reason why kids these days hate reading  because before they have time to read anything exciting and interesting they have to read stuff like the Scarlet Letter  The only reason Nathaniel Hawthorne is a classic is because he wrote fancy and he is dead  In fact Hawthorne never wrote an interesting word in his life  Its like he went out of his way to bore people to death  Now I know there wasn t much around to inspire good stories back than but I didn t think it was this bad  He drags on a plot that shouldn t of lasted more than    pages into a whole freakin novel  Pure insanity that kids are forced to read terrible bore fests like Hawthorne  Way too boring for me</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I believe that the plot of  The Scarlet Letter  could have been wonderful   something I would love to read  because the events are all such interesting ideas  I just think that Mr  Hawthorne made them boring through his writing style  Sometimes it just dragged on forever   I really think more of the book consisted of descriptions than dialogue   I couldn t enjoy a book like that  I think if this was written by a different author  with mainly the same plot  it could be wonderful  But this  was terribly boring         Great plot  horrible writing        </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I usually have nothing to say but good things about book I read  But this book  it does have it s interesting points but I just don t get into it  I rather would burn myself at the stake that read the remaining chapter I have to finish for my English Class  What did I have to do to deserve this  I stood there reading the book with my book in one hand and dictionary in the other  I ended up reading Chapter   about    times because the information wasn t getting to me  And the way the author addresses the reader  I want to scream  I m sure in the      s this was a wonderful book because of the message it stated back then  but more than     years afterwards  people seem to lose interest  And the fact that they make HS students read this book is just plain homicide  STOP THE ASSIGNING OF THIS BOOK  DON T PUT YOUR STUDENTS THROUGH TORTURE  get it away</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This novel is widely regarded as overrated  The plot is not that interesting  the writing style is torturous the plot twists are predictable  It s a typical example of pre   th century bad writing  Not to say that any book from that era is crap  but this book certainly is  Overrated Pretentious Trash</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>One ofthe greatest novels in all of literature  The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne  tells of a life vastly different from those that we live today  Rejecting the present permissive lifestyle to which we were accustomed  the reader is entrenched in the gloom and doom of Puritan society  It is an exposure to a law that tells what to wear  how to think  and whom to love  The Scarlet Letter is a story of law versus human nature  hypocrisy  and of undeniable passions Enlightening and refreshing  the reader is taken on an adventure and fully understands the risks of living passionately  beyond the limits that society sets  A novel that can be enjoyed by all ages  The Scarlet Letter is a masterpiece of its time  The Scarlet Letter</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hawthorne s masterpiece is beautifully written and skillfully constructed  It s message is subtle  yet pervasive  that people we punish as  sinners  are often far more noble than their punishers  Judge not  lest ye be judged  Best  or worst  of all  the story is still wonderfully applicable to contemporary life  Perhaps President Clinton ought to wear a big scarlet letter  A  on his chest for the rest of his term  A classic novel with a contemporary message</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>What greater journey than to delve into the human heart  Every emotion one can nurture there is here  bared and examined Hester  at once forthright and complex  serves as our guide  as she wanders the lambrynth of her own private neart That we can fall  sin  disappoint and still find redemption in confession make the message of The Scarlet Letter a most comforting tract for out day  Each read is like peeling layers of a rose</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Well paced  surprisingly easy to follow despite the language used  I hadn t read it in    years  and found it to be much more palatable as an adult than it was when I was a teenager  There must be a lesson in there somewhere     A better read as an adult    not a great choice for teenagers   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unless you have the correct size font  you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle  It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text  the next line has a single word  then another full line and so on  Don t pay for this on the Kindle</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>        worddI really liked this book because of Hester  She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety s rules  She is a role model for women who wish to be free  Sure  she made a mistake  But  don t we all  Adultery is not right  but we learn from mistakes I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own  It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period  Strong Woman</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It started with a great plot   until he actually wrote it  It was overwritten  it takes pages before something happens  and the protagonists were hard to like  Boring  sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose  There are a couple twists  but the main characters are such morons  it underscores the little action that does happen  Slow  Overwritten Drama</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>So sue me     I just don t like Nathanial Hawthorne  I think the plot is brilliant  but I find his method of telling the story annoying  I m afraid this isn t an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples  it s just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise  I find this true of his short stories as well  so I never bothered with the other novels  But you ll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway  so borrow it from the library  Great Story     Bad writing</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Thank you  Erika Vause  for your positive review  I absolutely love this book  I had heard of this novel  but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me  Then we read it in our academic English class    th graders  and I was absolutely astonished   Not only by the magnificence of the book  its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching  but by the ignorance of some of my peers  It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it  Please  please  read this book  You will not be sorry  I promise  Wonderful  wonderful</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I ll admit right up front that I am stupid  I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing  endless prose that Hawthorne uses  I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale  A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood    It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word  Classic  stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it  Yes  it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism  and it was  meaty   whatever that is    deep   and  powerful   but it was dry  slow  and boring  Even someone as myself  who generally enjoys the classics  will fall asleep  as I did everytime I tried to read this book   Do NOT try to speed read this  This book has no place in a high school English course  it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru  and then try to unravle  Awful</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough  Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring  So boring</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book  It has an okay plot and okay characters  but the book is not one for teens of the    s  I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it  The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society  If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev  Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller  I think this book should be only read voluntarily  If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider  The okay book</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I m sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better  if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language  I don t know about the production of narcotics in the      s  but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn t on a natural high if you know what I m saying  I HATE THIS BOOK</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>THIS BOOK SUX  Who cares about Pearl anyways  Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom    Don t READ THIS BOOK  </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Well  im    years old and my english teacher assigned this book for the class  I read only   of the chapters and then gave up   Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it   but it has nothing to do with modern life And to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless  Like I really care about what happenes to Hester  I ve failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same  Its one of those books where you read   pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today  Then i have to read the pages all over again  The book is extremely boring      I do not recommend it  If your looking to fall asleep than this is perfect   you  </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it  Then she decides to explain what s going on to you later  It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it  slowly falling asleep</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>typically  I will force myself to read even the worst books  for class  for  fun   because I think I should   but when I read this book for a       English course  I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever  not to be taken lightly  seriously   certainly not worthy of a classic  boring  endless details that no one cares about    blah blah blah  Terrible  I was bored  It might have been too difficult for a  th grader  but I wouldn t read it now either on the other hand  my brother loved it  one of the worst books I ve ever read</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This was the worst book I ever read  I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence  You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness  but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life  It s no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic  he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book  If you are a high school student like I am  you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again  And to you who have no read this book  don t  You have not  or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader  DO NOT READ THIS BOOK  Oh  and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book  there is nothing romantic about this novel  nor anything good  If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown  they can actually write  I only gave it a star because I had to </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that  while reading  I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr  Hawthorne s  work   Please  for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES    It will save you

I m not talking about Hester s crime  I m talking about this STUPID BOOK  If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house  see prologue   this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess ridden depths of Hawthorne s twisted thinking organ   You can figure THAT out on your own   This book is untolerably boring  the only proven cure of insomnia   if you don t mind the side effects  and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling  In the words of Mr  Hawthorne himself  this book is  ignominiously  dull  PRESERVE YOUR SANITY  NEVER READ THIS  NEVER I sleep now    A sin

after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck  right at the same time  both this and the great gatsby sucked  but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it forced to read the most horrible book ever</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Oh man  where do i begin with this one  First of all  I want to say that a   star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means  The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read  I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel  but if you can t stay awake to find it  what s the point  Also  it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use    letter words in each and every sentence  Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient  This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities  another  Classic    This book is a wast of good paper</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>this novel is of course set in england in

unheard of for me  Looooooooooooooooong </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Unfortunately  I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order  I ordered this book on Sept   for my daughter to read and write a report about for school   Report is due Oct     and to date  October    I have NOT RECEIVED it yet  When I contacted the vendor to report last week  I basically received a  sorry for your luck  but once it leaves our hands  we really don t care  type of response  Totally not impressed  Unable to Review</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This was one of the most boring books i ve ever read  Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel  that was a mistake  I d pass on this one if i were you  if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online  Painful</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read  The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won t know hat you are reading  From my point of view as a high school  with mostly A s and good at English  student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students  The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all  Long setences also makes the book drag on  If I didn t have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start  This book had me in tears because it was so difficult  I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me  Read this book at your own risk  but i do not reccommend it to anyone  Incredibly confusing  have a dictionary on hand </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I agree      that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer  But this book was horrible  A simple phrase of action  Hester walking down the street  would be   pages of reflection  I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck  J D Salinger  Mark Twian  I hated this book  It was took long and nearly impossible to read  If you have to read it for school  good luck  Otherwise  avoid this  There are much better classics than this  Save Yourself</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Three words to describe my feelings of this book   I HATE IT Hawthorne s writings are dull  dry  and other words that mean bad that start with D  The character s a boring  Ick </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Being in high school  it took a little bit to understand it  but after a while  I was able to get the basic point of the story  If you know you ll have to read this for school in the future  read it ahead of time  That way  you won t be reading on a deadline  which makes it worse  Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more  Also  the second time through  when you have to read it  you will see many things that you missed  and the story will be much more meaningful to you   You ll do better on tests and quizzes  too   Even if you re not required to read it  check it out it s not called a classic for nothing  confusing  but good</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed  not only was this a time of  witchcraft  and witchunts  but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery  as if it weren t punishment enough for hester to have to wear the  a  on her chest  everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society  i think this is overly harsh  yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well  i would recommend it  SAD</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This book literally put me to sleep  I could wake up at   in the morning and find the book in my lap  and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class  I mean  some of the sentences are about    lines long  and the plot  if there is a plot  is incredibly slow  If the author would just tell it like it is  and not drag it out for pages  the book would be only about a third of the length that it is  Boring  boring  BORING  The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I ve never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it  Well  I m glad I took the risk  I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates  The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully  Despite the fact that it wasn t full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner  I loved the way the book was written  each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem It made me concentrate too  It s not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time  this book required my full attention  great </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status  however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words  Beautifully Done</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation  It may have much symbolism and so on  but it is a convoluted mess  The author is completely detached from his audience  and for some bizarre reason  he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail  It is also irrelevant to our modern times  In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley  Orwell  Fitzgerald  Bradbury  Hemmingway  Steinbeck  Salinger  and many other great   th century writers  This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses  Not What it is Made Out to be   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways  I bought this as a gift  but not sure I will give it I guess someone might like the format  but I dont  hate this new format</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Once you get past the language barrier  this book is an amazing read  To see the tragedies that some women went through at one point in history is a great thing  and to remind us never to let history repeat itself  Wonderful</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book  While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it  I enjoyed some chapters  but loathed the ones describing the characters  I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene  The book made me feel inferior and uneducated  I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired  I enjoyed the general story line  but I could have left the adjectives behind  Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book  I would have been lost without Pearl s hints  I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher  Attack it if you dare   Need a dictionary </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Nathaniel Hawthorne s  The Scarlet Letter  is a vivid  and accurate  portayal of life in Puritan New England  The prejudices  superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers  who have little knowledge of New England s history  are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society  Indeed  this work is comparable  if not superior  to Arthur Miller s Crucible  An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yes  I am a    yr old high school kid  But I can tell good books from the bad ones   The Scarlet Letter  is a  classical  tale of   lovers  To be concise  this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable  People can say it s a classic romantic novel  it has good character developments  it has good themes and ironies  blah blah blah  I  like most people  don t judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors  all in all leave this book to a  Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy   If youre looking for a more entertaining classic  read  Huck Finn  by Twain  Leave this one to the bibliophiles</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Ok  when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic   I still can t  After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars  Also  it is one of the better books that I had to read for school  I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more  I still wouldn t reccommend this book to anyone Yes  I was another victim who had to read this for school</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America   and at a bargian price a book value</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Good read

this for English class and had some interest because I ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring I got the book on audio to assist me I only got to chapter   and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book  and possibly the movie It might not be the same to the book  but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better   Not interesting at all</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is one of the all time most boring books  I do not recommend reading it at all  The introduction is incredibly long  and incredibly boring  Also  it doesn t really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can t put down  I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book  I had much higher expectations for this book  If you are looking for a classic to read  I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo  not this book  This book is incredibly boring </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>First of all  those who found the book to be dull  such as me  listen to it on tape  it s abbreviated yet still dangerous   boring to listen to while driving  as I found out   Indeed  Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times  such as writing about a single mother  as well as musings about women s rights  His obsession with Victorian themes  such as the deification of children  fixation on bodily sins  as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader  While this book could probably be considered  a classic   such as Tolstoy s  Anna Karenina   both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories  Both forward and backward in its ideas</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  this the worst book i ve ever read  I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book  But the writing is superb  I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yes the writing is poetic   but the book says the same thing over and over  I didn t feel like I learned anything from reading this book  the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them  It s like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in  Not Worth Reading</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I read this book when I was    and I totally fell in love with it  I love the power it hands over to women  Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity  Power to women</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the   th century  however  this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter  The descriptions get very long  boring and tedious  As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you can t remember what happened for chapters at a time  The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book  it was very slow </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my   th grade English GT class s summer homework  I read and read  and I just started hearing names of people who  didn t make sense  I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is  or that other guy they talk about  I just went a long skimming the book  not able to feel any plot whatesoever  I was completely bored with this book  I didn t need a dictionary whatsoever either  but I will probably need Cliff Notes  so I could understand what the story is about  if anyone can help  please do  It wasn t good</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools  Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy  Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers  and that s fantastic  But for most kids  give them something they ll enjoy reading and maybe they ll learn to love literature more  Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers  ugh</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>At some point in your life you may have to read this snooze fest  and I pity the day you are required to read it  Hawthorne takes days to make a point  any statement at all  starting from the unbearable introduction  The custom house  through the last page  There is no action  no humor  no joy  only the character study of the puritan society  and a  brave  woman  Do yourself a favor and get the cliffnotes or use Antistudy com  Anyone who truly believes this is a good is either a pseudo intellectual  or they enjoy the same style of Melville  or anything written by Hawthorne  I would give this no stars if possible  A classic   but one of the worst books  ever </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Throughout this entire book  one part of my brain was in a state of wonder  trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal  sin  adultery  public shame and cowardice so dull  To finish the book was a test of will  and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone There are many fine  engaging  interesting novels  both of our age and of Hawthorne s  I can t imagine why one would want to slog through this one  How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>A classic  Hardly  In it s time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it s a struggle to get through  Hawthorne s writing style is dreary and dreadful  if captivating readers was his aim  he failed miserably  unfinishable</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner s attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic  The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death  note the reference   American classic my    </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Hawthorne s Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love  adultery  and sadness  Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life  The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published  and is therefore a revolutionary literary work  My only complaint is the length of  The Custom House   however horrible this sounds  I would just skip it  it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway  Hawthorne s Masterpiece</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I read Nathaniel Hawthorne s Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English    class  This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read  but I am glad that I read it The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love  society s oppression  secrets  a character finding herself  as well as numerous other classic literature themes  I found the book itself to be challenging to read  but I liked the story  Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion  which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it  it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year  When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test  this is the book I chose  Sure enough  this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature  Useful for AP Lit</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I enjoyed this book a lot  once I got past the slow parts  Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock  Since she won t reveal the identity of the father  she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter  A  on her chest for the rest of her life  She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around  so at the end of the book  people refer to her as  Angel  instead of  Adulterer  This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period  When we do something wrong  the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character  One event does not define us  It s our entire lives that should be taken into account  I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne s point  Redemption is possible for anyone  regardless of their sin  Also  the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader  suffers enormously because he doesn t confess  This is a good point  When we hide our sins  the only person it ultimately hurts  is us  Timeless Classic</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book  Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters  thoughts and motives that by the end of the book  you can understand why the people act the way they do  It makes them seem almost real  He relates nature to what the character s are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful  In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them  someone could always count on the nature s love  It s very beautifully written  The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader  It s just a great book all over  and I feel that it s one of the best ever written  One of the Greatest Books Ever Written</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I used to

was entertaining  It s a daring movie that take a rare look at what we ve been missing in today s corperate  hectic  kiss butt  culture  And that is emotional honesty  It s like a release  a drug  or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are  and not necessarily how we act in everyday life  We definately need more movies

serious genetic disorders and a single mom  How somebody could find it funny is beyond me If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you  If not   skip it  Nauseating </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it  but there are always exceptions If you re looking for a sweet Christmas tale  watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch  If you re looking for potty humor  watch Beavis and Butthead  This movie tries to be both  and in the end  the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray  leaving the viewer with nothing  Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a  moral  movie  please beware  it is far  far  from it  There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there  but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness  Spare yourself </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I thought this was a big dissapointment  It is crude beyond  good taste   I wish I could return the DVD but I don t have my receipt so I ll just  trash it   Adam Sandler s eight crazy nights</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others  How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me  Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes  A very disappointing movie</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY     One reviewer states   the funniest Christmas movie ever   This could not be farther from the truth  I like many of A  Sandler s movies  However  this movie sucked really bad  It was crude and not funny  reindeer pooping and eating poop    come on    It was irritating and not funny  the old man s voice was so grating  it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie   Most of all  the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company  I still can t believe I wasted       to rent it    Crazy Nights</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible  sickest humor he s done in any of his movies that I ve seen   Definately not for kids  I expected better after Mr  Deeds  Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash  I love the Chanukah Song  I m not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah There are only two real redeeming features of the movie  These are the little old man Whitey  because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like      and Stone s repentence  for lack of a better word  at the end  Clean it up </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I can t believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first    minutes  How in the world did anyone watch this for    minutes  So I only watched    minutes  but a movie that starts the way this one does is not getting any more of my time  My hairdresser highly recommended this  and all I have to say to her is  don t give up your day job to become a movie critic  Total garbage    star  since there s no  zero stars  available</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I couldn t tell you how this movie ends  we turned it off after the first half hour  Not appropriate for children  not entertaing for adults  Our dog even left the room  Don t waste your money  Eight Crazy Nights</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Someone I know bought this in a discount rack  thinking it was what it pretends to be    a children s holiday cartoon  Nothing could be further from the truth  I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is  full of perverted sexual innuendo  Movies like this should not be marketed toward children  and no matter what the rating  that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children s holiday cartoon  It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it  and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever   I can t give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves  I only gave it one star because they wouldn t let me give it none  Parents   Don t Let Your Kids Watch This Movie</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>  crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious  Adam Sandler was good and should be seen by families  sandler is da bomb</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds  that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years  Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one liners  I may have laughed once or twice if these movie  They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic s carrer  The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen  I went to see this movie with about   or   friends  when it was over  we all wanted our money back  The movie is not funny at all  Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy  there are alot of sad parts in it  but they label it as a comedy  All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids  huge waste of money  If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore  i want my money back</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I used to be a fan of The Simpsons  but now much more of a South Park kinda guy  so it s near impossible to offend me really   The humor was good in some spots  but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless  The emotion and general plot was pretty good  and I ve always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work  but this movie was bad  some of the singing was okay  but personally I didn t like half of it   Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating  but that s Sandler s great gold  terrible movie</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This movie was terrible  WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE  Well it starts out with Davey  a drunk who is crude and mean  Then when he gets into trouble he s doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney   No offence to little people out there  that it not my intention to offend anyone   Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack  and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn t any better Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney  That is until his place burns up  So he moves in with Whitney and his sister  and they set some ground rules  Then as the movie goes on  they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion  and when he cries it s all the sudden a big deal  And for some reason the deer in the woods talk  and help Whitney out  What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus I hate the music in it  the voices are annoying  and the characters are mostly unlikable  So warning to parents  keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie  Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yeah  it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids  but it isn t It s mean spirited movie that goes nowhere  It s crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler  but not even in a funny way  Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port a potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh tsicle   then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh t stuck in their teeth  Yup  that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein Please don t buy this  And if you do  BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it  The worst movie ever made</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums  actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy  Had i known this movie was so bad  i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY     ive seen this before           </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in

laugh so hard  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the same old same old holiday movies  Two thumbs up    Awesome</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I loved this movie  It was hilarious and Sandler s fans especially will be cracking themselves up  I must admit that it is very crude at parts  so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters  it probably isn t suitable for the young ones  Although  I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads The message is good and the overall story has a message  I cried for Whitey  and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch  But it is HILARIOUS  from the triple breasted lady  to Whitey and his sister  to the deer  who s significance I really didn t understand  A must see for anyone  over     with a good  but stupid  sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs  Hilarious</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This movie is great  but having it on   disc special edition maked it even better  The special features are the shiznit  Adam Sandler is Awesome</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This movie is awesome  It is the perfect movie for the holiday season  I am absolutely crazy about Whitey  the old man referee in the movie  Elenore and Davey are also hilarious  I love this movie and watch it over and over again with my whole family  Something you should buy because it is great  Smell you later poopsicles    A funny line from the best movie in the WORLD     Crazy about   Crazy Nights </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan  I loved him on SNL  I have enjoyed him in everything from  Billy Madison  to  Punch Drunk Love   So with that in mind  I had high hopes for  Eight Crazy Nights   To say it was a let down would be an understatement  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey  He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle  Sandler s Davey Stone character is so annoying  you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first    minutes  If you don t  you ll be treated to jokes about hairy butts  a woman with three breasts  a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces  Sounds appealing  doesn t it I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny  but I don t  Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last  Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I love Adam Sandler  Well  I used to love him  before he made Eight Crazy Nights  Not only was this cartoon not funny  it was downright trash  I would not recommend this  feature  to anyone   Eight Crazy Nights  was short on story  long on time  and wearing on patience  I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself  I needed some justification for wasting the   hours of my life that I will never get back  Needless to say  I stuck it out until the credits  and now I have to live with the facts that I      watched the movie  and     I ll never get that time back  So now I sit here  typing away a review I doubt anyone will read  wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie  HUMBUG  Watch  Ishtar   you ll get more out of it  Oh  and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star  I did this under protest  Nightmare Before Hannukah</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies  I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore  Sure  they re not great films  but they ve given me plenty of laughs  So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I ve ever watched  you ll know it isn t because of some bias against Mr  Sandler This may be the worst movie ever made  It is cloying  stupid  unfunny  weird  and pathetic  in a bad way  I could go on about the awful story  the grating voices  the cliches and schmaltz  or the bad songs   Yes  Virginia  this is a musical  The worst musical ever unleashed on film  No  I haven t seen every musical  but you don t need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks  Don t see it  Don t buy it  Don t rent it  Don t send any signal that they should make more cr p like this  Okay  There is a movie worse than Stargate </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I gave this   star because they wouldn t let me have   stars  The movie is just plain horrible  The    year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile  flatulence and other bodily function humor  But  this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves  It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film  Worse Movie I ve Seen In Ages</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>To be      honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible  To be honest    </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>Yeah well this movie was just terrible  Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible  I mean this is a stupid movie  one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him  It s almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more  The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler s character but once again it fails  we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge  This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film  And one last comment  Why the hell is this a double disc DVD  All of Sandlers good and or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment  This movie sucks  Sucks</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever  so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album  I always loved Corea with Farrell  because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe s flutes  sax  etc   like rain drops or storming  Nice soprano  And ELVIN JONES  I put this up up around the  Joe Farrell Quartet  album  and Buster William s bass is great  so much I don t miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland  A fresh sound  unparreled even now  It makes me want to see the Outback movie  The album cover is beautiful  Finally  the price is outstanding  Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way  return to forever proto type</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>In two of the episodes  the word  shut up  is used  My

it s missing from this way over priced version  As much as I love My Three Sons  I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy  Why so expensive   </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are     Elvis  opening production numbers  including a nicely staged  Adam And Evil        Deborah Walley s  girl drummer

ladies all want Elvis  gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that s so bad it ROCKS  I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys  provide  Elvis with     lots and lots of girls   And who was that chick  the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King  She looks like she s out to prove she can really score  and I never saw parts move like that before  Elvis looks embarrassed  Anyway  after you ve crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again  Simply awful  but I mean that in a great way  The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td> Spinout  has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage  They are Shelley Fabares  Diane McBain  and Deborah Walley  Looks like Elvis has a tough decision  I can t decide myself  In  Spinout  you ll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom  Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles  Also  the man who plays Shelley Fabares  father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on  The Donna Reed Show   So  try to not to knock this movie  It s got great songs and the title tune was a top    hit by just that much  So  treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can t understand why Elvis wants to stay single  Who else would have three beautiful women after him </td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td> Spinout         represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema   a bad sitcom without the laugh track  The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs  such as  I ll Be Back  and  Stop  Look and Listen   Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie  Presley s Worst Film</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through  thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline Elvis plays a singing race car driver  for the second time   who is being chased by three women  These include a spoiled brat  Shelley Fabares   an erotic author  Diane McBain   and his own drummer  Deborah Walley  The music is actually listenable in this picture  Highlights include  Stop  Look  and Listen  and  I ll Be Back  Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one  His appearance is also disturbing  slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head Again  not QUITE the worst  but far from the best  Buy something more worthwhile first  The music s better than the movie</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>This is not Presley s best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions  The movie songs are not a real treat either  he seems to be singing to everyone

lost my stylus  I didn t want to pay for shipping on a new stylus   pack from Handspring  so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead  Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly  but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus holder  Oh  and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time Not worth your time or effort  Piece of junk </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water  as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line  The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle  After a few minutes  you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card  which gives you your nitrite level  It s plenty easy and effective It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle  no need for that extra card lying around   or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value  but I ve never seen anything like that that doesn t expire at some point  Works and is easy to use</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This item arrived well packed and undamaged  It looks exactly like the picture  was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made  Of course  it is an  assembly required  piece of furniture  but once put together  it looks like a really nice quality piece  My daughter loves it  It is sized for a child  and is too small for an adult  I think she ll be able to use it through age    or     It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through  I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay  and Amazon was the cheapest of all  The chair comes included  so don t buy an extra chair separately  Great Buy </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is the best kids  desk you will find for the money  I can almost guarantee that  It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly  The wood is solid  not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores  Great Desk </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This desk is really pretty  It is a good size  but not overly big in the room  I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase  and not to order the chair separately  I also ordered the matching   shelf bookcase  which is a slightly different shade of white  but nothing too noticeable  especially since they aren t by each other  We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn t want to spend a fortune  but still wants something that looks nice  good quality for price</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework  It was not to

honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch  as a large hutch wouldn t work    and at a reasonable price  The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect  I took off one star because I didn t realize how short it was   ok for my   yr old son now  but as he grows up I m afraid he will outgrow the desk  It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows  I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height  Dear Kidcraft   please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be  normal  desk height for later years  making is a  Teen kraft desk      Thanks  Great Value for Less Money</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This desk is definitely worth the money  My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over       not including the chair  I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big  But once it was assembled she loves it  She is   and loves the little cubbies in the hutch  Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells  The hardware had everything you needed  no extras  in separate baggies for the chair and desk  I put it together myself in about   hour  We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great  With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax  there is no better buy out there  Trust me  I have looked  very nice</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I was

shoddy  and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like  you can t prove nearly anything empirically in education   straight from page      Some of the concepts presented are interesting  but since Mr  Jensen  no  he doesn t hold a doctorate  provides almost no citations for his claims  there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from  The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch  In fact  you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting  certified  in Mr  Jensen s unique   empirically unproven  techniques  Multilevel marketing meets education</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Mr  Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain  learning and so much more  He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read  I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it  too  for the students  sake  Well Researched  easy to read  practical</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>   Mr  Jensen and his wife have developed a veritable cottage industry replete with workshops  seminars  presentations  publications  certifications    if you ve got the money then they have something to sell you   and all of it is centered around what is termed  brain based learning    but what this book presents is little more than     pages of scientifically unsubstantiated claims and recommendations   for example  it claims that the color yellow somehow enhances intellectual performance and  hence  classrooms should be painted yellow   however  he doesn t offer a shred of evidence to back that claim up   it s all just ridiculous   how does this stuff ever make it into print   Pop  psychology at its worse   </td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so  no child is left behind  this book is a starting point about how people learn  The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life  Unlike those who consider brain research a  fad   I know from application of the knowledge in this book  the influential changes do produce positive results for students  In the world of  accountability  the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in  leveling the field  for the students from less fortunate environments  which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of  survivalists of poverty   I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to  get off the dead horse  and provide a productive environment for education in the   st century  Get off the dead horse of  old school  education</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This book was purchased for a PhD level course  It is a very easy read  It gives practical applications to the latest brain research  On a down note  there are not a lot of references documented within the text when Jensen quotes a study  but he does give an extensive bibliography  This book can be used for parents to read about how their child s brain works  or for teachers within a school system  It is a good book to read if you want basic information about the brain from an education standpoint  Easy read for brain information</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I have only read the first    pages of this book  so I d need to read the rest  So far  though  it is interesting but seems fuzzy  The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation  This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy  Given all the activations happening at once  in the brain   physical performance probably uses     precent of the brain   p      Probably  Why  Does any one activity use     percent of the brain  And if physical performance does  why is that important  Fuzzy around the edges</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I am currently reading the Kindle version of this book  The book itself is very easy to read and full of material to try in the class room  Unfortunately  there are no page numbers that correspond to the paper version of the book  As this is a text book  it is impossible to cite material and the page from which it was taken  This is really unacceptable for a text book  It is one thing if it were a literature book  and even then  it would be better to have the physical page number of the actual book  If I had known that there were no page numbers contained in this Kindle version  I would NOT have purchased it  I would have purchased a used hard copy  Brain Based Learning  The New Paradigm of Teaching</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification  This book is very easy to read  and I am really enjoying it  It presents info and then at the end of a section  recaptures the essence of the reading for you

shipping  So far  there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon  Brain based Learning</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>I find it hard to believe people fall for this stuff  He writes so much stuff that he pulls out of mid air  supposedly based on the brain research  If you are unfortunate enough to take a class that requires this  read it carefully  He jumps to conclusions with

when the Panasonic Showstopper with ReplayTV does not charge    Once a show is recorded to move through commercials you must fast forward  Pansonic Showstopper with ReplayTV has a    second quickskip feature  average commercial is    seconds    The channel guide is very complicated and very hard to navigate  Remember DOS  Panasonic showstopper with Replay TV s channel guide is very easy to

  To my surprise and disappointment  I found  Foundation  to be an exceptionally terrible  book   totally undeserving of the praise it has received here  As some of the other reviewers have pointed out  the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed  It is not only very dull and dry  but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art  The dialogue is simply dreadful  the character development is nonexistent  and the story is pointless and not at all well structured  The fact that this alleged  novel  is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent  as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections  This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature  In fact  the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing  atrocious story telling  and science fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration      A very bad

  but I honestly don t see what s so great about this book  Daniel Keyes   Flowers for Algernon  and Arthur C  Clarke s  Childhood s End  are both better science fiction stories than Dune  They make powerful  emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes  If you want epic literature  read Lord ot the Rings  That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth  Everything

 REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER   I like a good slasher movie  the more gore the better  I like suspense and drama too  This movie tried to combine them all   and actually did a fairly decent job  It could of been a solid   star beauty in the rough  HOWEVER  I m getting a little miffed at movies that have an anti hero ending simply to make it more artsy or make the director feel like there s some kind of deep meaning  Some life changing moment in film That s fine and dandy if your owning a   star file  for instance Cold Mountain   kills the hero and still ends up being a fine movie   Or your solid

 This movie looks exactly like a cheap TV show  Many of the sets look fake   Some of the fighting scenes are good  Some are bad because of poor editing and filming   The fighting scenes are non stop from the beginning of this film to the end  There s no time for character development  For example  the   brothers fought against each other in many scenes  Each time  one of the brother had a chance to kill the other brother but he stopped it when seeing a big scar on that guy s neck  Then the director did not give the characters time to investigate the scar further  He just showed the two fighting again and again in the following scenes  And then the same guy stopped the fighting when he saw the same scar again  It s so silly that it s boring   In short  it s a waste of money  I d rather watch Iron Monkey again  This empire crumbled to

 stars for the movie  One star for this disc  I bought this to upgrade from the previous release on DVD which was a very good quality DVD  As this was Criterion and Blu ray I expected the best print yet of one of my favorite films  To my disappointment this disc if full of snowy grain and flickering in any of the darker scenes  The opening shot of Vanessa Redgrave walking around the house in the evening is ruined with a blizzard of snowy grain  Some of the scenes have a grid like band across them  I am assuming this is from a defective batch as I see other people are having similar problems  Yet other people seem to not have problems so obviously not all discs released are bad  I  however will be returning this piece of junk  If there is a better disc out there I would like a replacement

A Pleasant Shade of Grey  is a semi concept album that is basically one song divided into many smaller parts  I m not sure why this is classified as progressive metal  because while it certainly is progressive  it is definitely not metal  There are very few crunchy riffs and two melodic  but ultimately boring solos  This is better described as progressive ambient  What I love about progressive metal is that you can get all pumped up and still think at the same time  This definitely makes you think  but it is about as exciting as watching paint dry  If I wanted to think and be bored I could read one of my high school textbooks  If ambient stuff is your thing  and you like those weird Pink Floyd songs like the ones from  The Wall   you should pick this up  But if you are looking for adreniline pumping progressive metal  look elsewhere  like Andromeda or Savatage  Does Not Live Up To

Analize This  was a big hit based upon a great concept and a couple of yuks  And that s about all this film has  The theme is somewhat similar to  The Sopranos  with the big time gangster seeing a psychiatrist  But any five minutes of  The Sopranos  has more wit and imagination than this entire movie  Robert DiNiro does a good job playing his stereotypical gangster role for laughs  and he does manage a few  Billy Crystal  on the other hand  is yet again playing the same character he plays in just about every movie he s in  That wouldn t be so bad if the script didn t completely take plausibility for a ride   The Sopranos  is so good  and funny  because it seems so real   Analyze This   especially the horrendously unbelievable and unfunny climax  scene rings so hollow and so false that it becomes nearly unwatchable for any true fan of gangster movies  Bottom line  if you are a gangster buff  fughettaboutit   The Sopranos  it ain t by a longshot

other in many scenes  Each time  one of the brother had a chance to kill the other brother but he stopped it when seeing a big scar on that guy s neck  Then the director did not give the characters time to investigate the scar further  He just showed the two fighting again and again in the following scenes  And then the same guy stopped the fighting when he saw the same scar again  It s so silly
