direction  acting and general quality are barely b movie  The lighting and set ups are pure low budget and I had trouble getting past that and into the concept Make sure to watch this in Spanish  as bad as the subtitles are  they are masterful next to some of the worst English dubbing I ve ever heard All in all  we were very bored very quickly  this movie has some scenes that are just sheer nothingness posing as suspense  and once you ve figured out the main idea  it s all pretty obvious  I ve seen dozens of time travel movies and this is easily one of the worst made No matter how good your premise is  if the filmmaking is weak the film itself is going to be subpar  Timecrimes is the perfect example of that
